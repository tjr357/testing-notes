# What if drugs were like code and it would make you super smart with side affects


*   What if drugs were like code and it would make you super smart with side affects

*   the code parts could be woven into drug names
*   people want to do these "drugs" because the code they produce is amazing
*   there's a whole ecosystem/community where when you take the drug you have to contribute back to that drug or you'll have consequences(kind of like Repo Men)
*   There are obviously side affects to each drug
*   companies want to hire these programmer because their code is so good
*   someone experimented with food first but people got really sick, then it transitioned to sports but they were considered PEDs
*   then drugs were tried and the results were crazy
*   think Repo Men and Limited
