# Dougs Story Idea!!!!!!!


Alright, I was going to wait to tell you this tomorrow, but I think I know how to incorporate it all into a rough plot.  The ship you pilot has been sent to Earth from an obliterated colony in space in the near future.  The ship was constructed from the same technology that an alien superweapon used to wipe out the colony.  In an attempt to wipe out every last bit of its own technology which it fears is a threat, the alien superweapon is approaching Earth to finish off the last ship.  The weapon itself however, is guarded by these Guardian weapons, resembling ancient alien deities which were known for their ability to control the elements.  The only way to destroy the alien superweapon is to destroy the Guardians that protect it by docking your ship into them, and as the player, destroying them from the inside-out.  The final battle with the alien superweapon would be a variation of both ship and player combat In order to go from Guardian to Guardian, your have to pilot your ship through a shmup level.  Your ship has basic weaponry, but it can fire special attacks based on the elements derived from the alien technology.  When you dock at a ship, your player hacks the Guardian in order to destroy it, and the enemies (or defenses) you kill while inside will not only level up your weapons, but the enemies will drop energy based on the weapon you killed them with and their nature, which you can then use at the end of each level to power up your ships weapons.  The actual player combat represents hacking the Guardians, and the player must not only destroy the final computer program boss within each Guardian, but must then upgrade their ship to do battle with the Guardian shmup bosses as well.  THE END

Hahaha I'm glad you like it.  :)  Minus Ninjas, it incorporates everything we talked about, and in a way that makes sense and combines both ancient and futuristic worlds.  Maybe both the ship and the player can have a standard weapon, and in the player's case, it's a sword.  It does the absolute minimum base damage to all enemies, but he can wield it like a Ninja.  ;)

Alternate to the main story, main character escapes from the alien colony/ship?

Have an alienistic tribal like language and have there be secret messages throughout the game, leave it up to the player to unlock the different letters and figure out how to decipher the secret language. The hidden letters could be hidden in levels like KONG in DKC or have the player do something to unlock them.
