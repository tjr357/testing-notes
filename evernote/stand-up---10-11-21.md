- Email updates are going out regardless of the Article's publication status
- Do we need to update the Article if it's NOT Published?
- Drafts have expiration dates because it's a required field
- Would too many draft articles cause things to be cluttered?
- Ashritha to update the AC so only Published Articles will receive update emails
Could we create an enhancement to change the logic for 2 weeks before the article expires
We could inspect and adapt later

Create the enhancement card, create in Service Kit Feature enhancements
Look at Ashritha's card for the Feature enhancement
