# Delivering Business Focused Value 10/28/21


How can we give them what they want instead of what they asked for?
We don't write stories from the perspective of what customers asked

As a user
I asked for a quarter inch drill
so I can drill a hole in the board

How do we encourage people to continue to practice

I don't want to recreate the wheel and think and have the conversation

Do we know what a User Story is?

What do we perceive to be a user story now?
\-

Stories are written with user focused but are we missing the mark

Not enough shared understanding within the program to why to write user stories
