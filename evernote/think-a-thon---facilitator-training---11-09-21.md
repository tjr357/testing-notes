# Think-a-thon - Facilitator Training - 11/09/21


Get people into the design thinking mindset
6-7 others will be in the group
Usher small groups from one "venue" to another
Don't be afraid to reach out for help - Joe and Sarah will be floating and readily available

Consider yourself part of the team, fully participate
Get through the activity, keep things flowing, keep them on time

Always have these up on the screen:
\- Think-a-thon Run of Show in Mural
\- Think-a-thon Activities in Mural
\- Chats in Teams

Tech check scheduled for Wed. afternoon

Message Lauren for tech issues in the Q&A channel

at 9:50 we will go to the specific group Mural
START the specific meeting at that time

It's okay to not have all the answers right off the bat

Model good behavior: turn camera on, participate, encourage

Stay focused on the scope

Let the ideas flow, paint in broad strokes and then filter later

People might be hesitant, may want to call on people ask them and then I start typing what they're saying

It's the interviewees perception, they are the expert in their field, they are interested in this topic

If there's silence, let them talk to fill the silence

Don't share the screen until we show the video, this will keep them engaged, maximize participation

Why are people saying the things they're saying/thinking, put that into words

Be free and open, don't judge your ideas, just do it

If we could do something, money and time wasn't an obstacle
Encourage wild ideas

Give people a minute to read them and then choose in their mind what they want to vote and then have them vote all at the same time
