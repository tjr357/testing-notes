# Worker Placement Card Game


2 player worker placement card game
The cards are the worker placement spots

On your turn you play a card and then place a worker on another card.

Workers go back to players when there are too many cards, a player wants that card a worker is on

Maybe workers can be stolen

Cards could be placed spatially, combo off other cards too
Portal cards

Maybe monkeys or cats are the workers!
The card locations are toys, obstacles for them to play on.
Making them happy is the victory points
