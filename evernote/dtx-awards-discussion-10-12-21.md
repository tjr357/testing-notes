# DTX Awards Discussion 10/12/21


There will be one more push tomorrow morning,
email in the morning

We'll reorganize nominations instead of throwing them out,
we'll do that next week
These kind of things should be for the review
\- Here's the category it's originally nominated for
\- Then share with HR

Add 2 or 3 columns for the HR piece and comments

Alyse to draft a hand-off email for next year

Extend it one more week to get TAG folks

Leanne and Alyse will check spreadsheet for TAG folks

Do we have the whole DTX planning committee
Remove people's names to keep it unbiased

would WiIT have a different more expensive award because they're willing to pay for it
