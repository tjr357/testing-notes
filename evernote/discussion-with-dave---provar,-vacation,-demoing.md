# Discussion with Dave - Provar, Vacation, Demoing


Dave will reach out to

Brian Horvath and asking him where we're at with the master agreement

Send Dave the Prodly vs. Provar comparison

Send the Executive summary
Include the number of licenses
estimate of how many we'll need
include the 5 teams TCS, SAND, Red, Service, EMEA

we could always increase later on

This will save this much time
Might have to identify tool savings and hard savings

Return on Investment

Figure out the implementation piece
\- Training
\- Assistance to help people learn it
\- How do we get a workshop session to help others
\- What are some things we would have to redo
\- How would we have to change the AAT process
\- Create a go-live kind of document
\- AAT documentation
\- Does the training need to be a new project?
\- Re-evaluate what we need to cover
\- Any other use cases
\- Get the Provar trial extended, just in case, why not
\- How much faster can we get regression tests and expand the test coverage

Get the vacation day in as soon as possible, not through Kronos

Schedule another meeting to discuss the Demoing
    - We want to figure the problems on the story quicker
    - For the IP Sprint
    - Is there a potential for Sprint goals?
        - Showing the demo after some cards are completed
    - Include Dave and Bill
    - Use it to revisit the decision since we haven't done it yet
    - The idea is to make it easier for Aubrey and ourselves
    - By showing the workflow, it should help us with understanding the business process better, as an incentive
