# SAND Retro 10/20/21


What went well
\-----------------------------------
IW CPQ Go Live
\- Went soooo smoothly, both Steve and Shannon were out and they were NOT needed
\- Chris, Steve and Shannon answered a lot of questions and helped Sruthi learn about CPQ

SAND was enabled
\- The team was blocked from having any direct tie to the business and why
\- Discovery went well, weekly meetings, directly hearing about the business and what people liked and disliked about the sales process
\- Everyone was involved that needed to be, the right people were in it, took good notes and shared
\- Respectfully pushed back
\- Directly speaking to folks was invaluable
\- It reduced the telephone game
\- Reduced the business solutioning

What didn't go well
\---------------------------------------------------------

Pair programming
\- doesn't seem like we're allowed to use this, even though it was suggested
\- it was extremely disliked by
\- the team said they were interested in this
\- it was odd that there was this much push back
\- it should be embraced more
\- excitement was shot down,
\- need to show more and do more
\- gut wrenching not agile
    - not understanding this
\- felt the pressure to turn more points
\- "we're not self organizing" not feeling trusted
\- this is a big concern

What are the action items for this?
\- How can we pair program and show the benefit
\- We want to be able to work on the story in the best way possible
\- Can we get buy-in, please trust us to do it in the best way possbile, give us a way to fail quickly and learn from it

At times processes and procedures seemed inflexible even for a self organizing HPT
\- There should be trust in the team
\- Follow the process but there are exceptions where the team should be able to make the decision to push something
\- People should just say "okay" instead of saying "this is not part of our process", it's a norm and not a law, it's "normally" what you do, but there has to be some wiggle room
\- We should retro on this even more
\- RACI chart
\- Norms should be retroed

\- As things come up don't just WAIT until a retro
\- Even if we can't do something, please share why I can't do something

\- How do we prove that what we want to do for the better, is the better

There's the perception that we have to be  "doing agile" instead of "being agile"

What do we stand to lose if we don't lose, don't transform

We can give you a better product if you'll let us talk to the business

There's no customer relationship

Nobody retro's on the actual software work, it all comes down to the process

All kudos are on the team!
