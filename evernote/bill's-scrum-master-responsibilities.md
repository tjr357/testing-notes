# Bill's Scrum Master Responsibilities


Hey Bill, I wanted to list out all of your duties/responsibilities on the Service team. This is what I have thus far. When you have a moment please, what did I miss/get wrong?

Scrum Master Responsibilities on Service

schedule/facilitate/prepare for:
Daily stand ups
Fan 4's/Refinement
Retros
Sprint planning
Release Planning
Pre-Release Planning meetings
Feature break down
User Story Mapping
Provide SoS updates
Ensure flow of work
User stories
Enhancements
Defects
Spikes
Identify and alleviate any blockers

Other items:

Expand Retro's to include Team, Program, Feature, and Card level.
Adjust Owner on card to PO and then back as needed to facilitate reporting
Review completed Defects using Work Views (Service Team - Defects with Missing Fields) in Rally to make sure they are complete and accurate.
Review Current and future sprints to ensure card sequences and due dates are in alignment.
Move unfinished cards to next iteration at the end of the sprint.
Hold team meetings (6 months) to review Team Norms - more often if needed.
Update team information in SharePoint for Service.
Provide supplemental information on card flow and sequencing (Visio's).
Promote Agile practices and principals at all times.
Organize and communicate with the team and others to promote the completion and understanding of work in progress, and the migration process. Sometimes this is leading and other times assisting others that are leading.
Assist with User Story Card creation, "As a, So that" discussions, when cards need split, deleted, or added.
