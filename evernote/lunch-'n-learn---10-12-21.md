# Lunch 'n Learn - 10/12/21


Iman - Improving Hybrid Working Conditions

His wife's office was closed in NYC, everyone is working from home.

There will only be 1200 parking spots at the new HQ, which is a problem because there are 3000 people at HQ.
Hybrid will be the future

How can we make this Hybrid working situation better?

2/3 people believe traditional office setup will be obsolete by 2030

Remote work has grown exponentionally

There are so many things that people are doing during conference calls

Webcams build trust, trust allows us to move faster

Increases engagement

Facial expressions

Less interruptions because you can see who's speaking

It's going to be difficult to work in the office if we forget how to be interactive with each other

We should be looking at each other as a family

Caveats:
\- If there are a lot of people in the meeting
\- Bandwidth issues
\- Do people have enough screens and equipment
\- There are certain situations where you cannot use your camera
\- Not as motivated to do hair and makeup
\- Some people just do NOT like being on camera
    - "I don't see myself when I'm in-person"

Leveled the playing field for teams that were already working remotely before hand.

People cannot multitask

Be open and honest in why you're not sharing the screen

Iman is more comfortable presenting at home

Amy Cuddy - fake it until you become it
