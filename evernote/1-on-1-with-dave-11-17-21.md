# 1-on-1 with Dave 11/17/21


Provar training
Think-a-thon
DT Skill sharing

*   [x] CC all the Delivery Leads on the Provar training
*   [x] Work with folks to make sure they have everything installed
*   [x] Add it to the Sharepoint calendar

*   [ ] Create the implementation plan,

December - being used
After this training, go back and do a card or 2 by this date
Now that you've gone through this, where do you think this can be applied
Do that immediately after the training
This is not optional, if I need help communicating this, let Dave know

Do this by a team by team
After the new year, let's get the other teammates involved

*   [x] Reach out to Clint and see if he can cancel his trip,

there will be more complexity
Not value added at this point
Technical problems, etc. at the expense of everyone else

There would be a lot of logistics,

For the Perf review, be ready to show examples that showcase

*   [ ] Map out the goals if possible, maybe in a Spreadsheet

*   [ ] Review the Yearly goals

"Take care of your house first"

Delegate when needed and know when to say "no" when there are too many plates spinning

I don't need to test everything but It's my responsibility to make sure everything gets tested right
