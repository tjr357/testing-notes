# Game Ideas 3


Have a 2D action game where the gimmick is the players weapons can be randomly crafted from tetris like pieces, in a grid like system they create a basic shape and a weapon comes from that, different colored pieces give certain buffs, maybe each weapon lasts 30 seconds? Could be a shmup or driving game too?

2D game, probably a platformer, where there are 4 types of objects in the level, and each object is assigned to a face button, the player can only move the character but all the other actions come from the environment

2D game where the character loses/leaves random piece of armor/equipment in each level. When they beat the game, there's a new game but with a different character that picks up the pieces that were left behind.Â 

Another spin on that is, the second run through is cleaning up the "mess" the previous character left in the world?

A 3D game where the character has to create HUGE origami, from paper, in the world. There would be different monsters /abilities that can cut paper or add special properties to the papers. The character can pick up a corner of the giant paper and fold it, maybe have a visual fold guideline. You would be able to make a paper airplane, to fly in, boats, frogs, cranes fortune tellers, paper craft, hats, crumple pieces of paper for ammo, maybe create weapons too?

Create brickbreaker but change the shape of the paddle to be a circle, zig zagged, a triangle. So when the ball hits the paddle it will react differently depending on the angle it's hit at. Maybe have a pinball type table.
