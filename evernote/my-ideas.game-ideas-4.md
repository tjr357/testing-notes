# Game Ideas 4


2D platformer where the players control inputs for the current level create the level layout for the next level. Almost rogue-like.

Create a game where the character is a clutz and accident prone. The player will play the game and then all of a sudden something bad will happen like, trying to hold the door open for an elderly couple and the handle comes off, walking up steps but then you fall through. There were be all sorts of bad luck events sprinkled in the world. If something breaks that piece can be used in puzzles. This could take place in a neighborhood like setting.

Have a shmup but have some ships your character can board and either turns into a twin-stick shooter or a rogue-like type game. Have ship management and upgrades too?

Have a 3D game where the character can interact with the surroundings and giant creatures. Kind of like Brothers (game), but kind of have the player fetch certain items in order to progress. Would be linear, need item A to get past obstacle A or items A, B and C are all needed to get past obstacle A. There's a gap by a giant, feed the giant beans and it farts and the character has to catch the jet stream to get across. Capture the feeling of awe and exploration.

2D platformer with 3D graphics,  with a turtle and frog duo. Takes place in nature, the frog can ride the turtle, the frog can hide in the turtles shell, they can swing with the frog's tongue, etc.

A 2D side scrolling game, the players have to pass a ball around and that's the only thing that can damage enemies. Could be a co-op and if single player maybe kind of like Frozen Synapse asynchronous

A football game like Blitz but after each play there is a short wrestling match and the player has to pin them for points.

A rogue like football game

An awkward turtle game, the more awkward the situation the more awkward the turtle reacts

A dumb 3D game where you're character has to balance items from point A to point B and try and navigate around obstacles

Shadow of the Colossus meets THPS!

3D game, play as a getaway driver, drop people off for missions,  provide help on the missions too. A mix of Crazy Taxi and gta driving

Top down crossfire game, the balls are reusable ammo. There's a shield class, the object is to score the ball/disc in the opponents goal. 3 on 3

2D game 2 on 2, characters are on a wire they can jump up like a trampoline or they can hang below. Try to score a goal by throwing a ball in a ring. Players can knock other players off into lava. All directions, jump, duck, pass, shoot ball towards ring.
