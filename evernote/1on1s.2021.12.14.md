# 1-on-1 with Dave - 12/14/21


The job fair

Don't limit myself to just one day, "if I had more than one day...this is what I would do"
Keep an open mind, don't think about choosing a prescribed agile process

\- Review other people as well (Sarat & Kate), provide feedback for Bill and Chip if I have any
\- What ideas do we have to help with the frustrations with Aubrey

\- Let Dave know if people are not being supported and if they are not doing their part

\- Leverage Kate to see if she can help with the GI Rush Batch test scenarios

\- Reevaluate the IDP

\- Is there a possibility to oversee all the new BAQA's 3 of them in KL
    - Directly or indirectly
    - What would be the expectations
    - Think about it

\- Is there a way for us to report on who is using Provar at the time
