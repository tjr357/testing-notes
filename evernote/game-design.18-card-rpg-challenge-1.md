Player cards secret set of words to use

On turn Player rolls dice, what set it lands in they further along that character's story, then they pull a card and read a scenario for that character. The player controlling that character takes a die and secretly chooses 1, 2 or 3 trying to predict what the other player will choose for their character. If they are correct, then the scenario passes and all players stats go up or something. If they are incorrect then a die must be rolled to see if that situation is passed or not (1,2,3 passes, 4,5,6 fails)

Local news report, and newspaper clippings, several dogs have gone missing, missing posters on telephone poles

On the way to the game

Kids hear a beeping sound, that's strange, distinct pattern, coming from the old radio tower, a 1/2 mile up the hill from the field

Dogs freaking out over fireworks
