# Business Focused Value Discussion


What do we stand to lose if we don't focus on the Business Value?
\- We tend to focus on tasks that make us move faster
    - Faster could result in missed requirements, bad code, etc.
\- We could miss out on getting empathy for our customers
    - Which 1 people don't understand what they're working on and how it affects real people
    - If we deliver a bad product experience to our customer
        - We could lose them as customers
        - Lose their interest
        - Not use the product, which could lead to inconsistency with reporting, etc.
        - Their jobs become more difficult especially if there's no work around
\- We won't grow as an organization because we'll be order takers
    - We need to build trust between the business and DT
        - Respectfully pushing back and being honest and open creates trust if we can see we all have the same goal in mind

Put problem statements into PowerPoint
Beth will create a PowerPoint and transfer everything over there

then we vote in our next meeting

Is it that we're not focused on the Business value OR the Customer value?

Some of the user stories have been written from the "How" perspective
vs.
the intent of bringing customer value
