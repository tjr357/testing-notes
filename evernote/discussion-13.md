# Discussion


*   Stacy wants to hear mine and Chris’ thoughts
    
*   We’re struggling to work as a team
    *   Distance probably doesn’t help
*   Some are concerned automated tests are bad and we’re not all aligned with the status of them
*   We need proof that things don’t work
    *   nothing’s visible
    *   Show metrics/**knowledge**
*   Find certain areas are flakey or always failing
*   Pair as testers to show API tests may work better
*   Create a spike to allow X amount of time
*   How can we help create API tests, collaborate more and come together as a team
*   People know that I “despise the automation tests"
    *   Get to a point where I can live with it
*   Influence others
    *   L may not be ready to hear this change (API tests)
*   Know that I cannot do anything about the 25% and 75% time
*   Go after the pieces I can touch
*   Can we get an automated report?
*   Look at what broke our tests
*   It’s just knowledge, find things to help uncover
*   I told Stacy about me feeling like I provided value for the first time in 8 months
*   What do we do to provide value to the teams/program/company
*   Kari - we’re not using design patterns from Salesforce
    *   These are failing because of the design, can we prove this?!
*   We need to educate ourselves to help educate others, do our homework and prove the good, bad, ugly
