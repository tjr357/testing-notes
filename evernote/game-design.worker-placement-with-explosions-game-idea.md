# Worker Placement with Explosions Game Idea


Worker placement with explosions.

Workers can be bombs or they leave bombs

The timer is visible to all

Other players can go to that spot but if they stay too long, they run the risk of going boom and losing that worker forever.

Or are the spots explosive?

Or what if the spots trapped the workers and they cannot be used and the spot no longer gives benefits

If explosive, then there should be chain reactions

The dice are the bombs, which are rolled at the beginning of the round and then they count down
