\- This is correcting the miscommunication that's there right now
\- We're not changing the decision making process of which plants are being chosen
\- Remove the Lead time from the picklist values and change the field
\- Aubrey will ask Lisa what was the original purpose of having the Lead time there in the first place

S65656
\- Remove the Plant Line field, it's no longer needed
\- Do we care about historical data on this field?
\- Where is this field used right now? Any reports?

S65657
\- Master REX, indicates what paint's actually in the can, unique to North America
\- The Plants are asking for this to be required, they are refusing to fill the request if the Master REX is not filled out
\- Work with STEP to see if Master REX is available
\- We don't want the agent to fat finger the incorrect number into the field

S65658
\- We don't want agents to edit the Web Email field, this is the From address
\- This should be a read-only field across all page layouts

S65659
\- The Toller business is no longer accepting rush batches
\- Could we make them inactive?

S65660
\- "Transferred to Shipping" will automatically be selected
\- Could we remove "New" Case Status and have it default automatically "Transferred to Shipping"
\- This will make sure the Cases get added to the workflow automatically

S65661
\-

S65662
\- We are told that the agents are not choosing the 3rd Party option

S65742
\- Remove Lead Time from Roles, Workflow
