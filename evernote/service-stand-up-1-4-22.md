# Service Stand Up 1/4/22


Aubrey can do refinement meetings at 10 - 11 to accommodate Tao

S62213
\- Sarat to work on

S65655

S65659

DE16288
\-Â  SF is receiving 2 different ids which is why there are duplicate cases being created. They are both being created at the same time

DE16492
\- Work around was in place, we no longer be able to use the ootb record trigger flow, Sarat worked with Austin to explain the workaround which is a manual process to update the invoices
\- will not need ISA's help, it's a Salesforce issue
\- Sarat will close card, this is to "stop the bleeding", a more long term solution should be a card later on
\- Sarat attached logs in a .zip to the card

Not much to discuss in refinement today

Deployment is going to be on Thursday
