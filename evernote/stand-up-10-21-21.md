After Stand ups
Dave will be sharing DT news as he can and be more transparent
Susan met with Rajesh to talk about the DT transformation
Is more of a people person
We don't have common definions of things,
just by saying we have a product team, people could mean different things
Inclusitivity, innovation and PoC's,
Org structure questions are still being addressed, what philosophies
Wanting to be more agile and try things and not have analysis paralysis

??Tamara is leading the agile team??
