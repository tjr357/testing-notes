# Discussion with Dave


We should be doing Fan 4's on cards in the previous iteration

Do we assign people's names on the cards before the Fan4, so they are interested

Dave trying to make this a safer space,
not just providing requirements, getting people to think about what the user needs

Aubrey will want to get exacting AC's
we cannot be asking Aubrey "what do you want to see?", how do we safely push back, Gherkin can be stressful and seen as a waste of time
The PO role is stretched thin, not enough time to do that role
How do we make our time with the PO the most efficient, could we share the AC's or a screenshot of them to help

Beth has a Journey Map from the Facility visits

Set the expectations correctly for User Story Mapping
\-Â  should be used when enhancing functionality, or new functionality
\- don't use it for sharing rules, giving permissions,

Figure out the best value, cost
