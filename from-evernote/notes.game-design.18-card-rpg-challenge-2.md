# 18 Card RPG Challenge


3 characters, 10 year olds. 1 card each. Boy/girl on different sides.
Sneaking through the neighborhood at night to play baseball or hide and go seek or capture the flag or flashlight tag. Then they need to go back home.

Items and weapons will be on multi purpose cards that get tucked under character card in different orientations.

Cards should probably ask questions of the players to make interesting choices.
The neighbor's dog gets loose and chases you: do you run or do you throw something to distract and lose that item for now?
