# DTX Awards Discussion 10/19/21


Could we split the Team nominations for Leadership into individual nominations

Thank you for reaching out, this award is meant to be for an individual, ask the person who nominated, ask them to give more details OR ask them which award would they like

Move spreadsheet to the Awards Committee channel
Gather all PDF files into the Submissions folders

Leanne to reach out to Matt Stec on getting TAG representation

Alyse to craft email to Ivy, Matt, Carolyn Lekan, etc.
    - to tell them current state,
    - nudge to Matt,
    - have them weigh in on the selection process
        - ask them if they're okay to anonymize it

Alyse to reach out to Milicia Krusser:
\- Different feedback groups in DT and maybe TAG IT
\- This would help with the peer review
Voice of the Manager (meets monthly)
Voice of the Employee Group (meets adhoc)

Have employees vote anonymously so it's not a popularity vote

Leanne to reach out to Matt Stec, to get him to push it

Keep this Friday

Alyse reaching out to Alex Aiocole
\- Do we have enough nominations globally?

About
1300 - DT employees globally
430 - TAG IT employees and that includes contractors, 283
