# Testing Documentation Discussion with Jakub


Testing documentation

it was a surprise the FULL env got refreshed, even though it was on the calendar
The test data was lost
People need admin access

We were looking at tool called, Data Mask, that would help with data copying
This would make it anonymous and scramble the data

We should have a script that will create data

2 types:
\- Ad-hoc
\- Momentary
\- Then there's data that's needed outside the scope

We need sample test data
If there's a specific user that has an issue, we should be able to recreate it in QA

Share this with other testers
