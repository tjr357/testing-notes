Read: [Revelation 22:1-5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A1-5)
There shall be no more curse. —[Revelation 22:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+22%3A3)
Bible in a Year:
[Jeremiah 40-42; Hebrews 4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+40-42%3B+Hebrews+4)

Amy had battled cancer for 5 years. Then the doctor told her that the treatments were failing and she had just a few weeks to live. Wanting some understanding and assurance about eternity, Amy asked her pastor, “What will heaven be like?”

He asked her what she liked most about her life on earth. She talked about walks and rainbows and caring friends and the laughter of children. “So, then, are you saying I will have all of that there?” she asked longingly.

Amy’s pastor replied, “I believe that your life there will be far more beautiful and amazing than anything you ever loved or experienced here. Think about what’s best here for you and multiply it over and over and over. That’s what I think heaven will be.”

The Bible doesn’t describe in detail what life in eternity will be like, but it does tell us that being with Christ in heaven is “far better” than our present circumstance (Phil. 1:23). “There shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him” (Rev. 22:3).

Best of all, we will see the Lord Jesus face to face. Our deepest yearnings will be fully satisfied in Him.

We’re thankful, Lord, for Your presence now
in our lives. But what an amazing day it will be
when we meet You face to face!
Life with You in heaven will be greater by far.
To be with Jesus forever is the sum of all happiness.

#### Insight

In some translations of the Bible, the book of Revelation is entitled “The Revelation of St. John,” giving attention to the human author John, one of the disciples of Jesus. This title, however, is inaccurate. In Revelation 1:1, we read, “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants—things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John.” This is significant because the word _revelation_ means “a revealing or unveiling.” The primary purpose of the book is to give us an unveiling of Christ Himself. Interestingly, that unveiling reveals Jesus to be the Lamb of God, and the word _lamb_ appears in Revelation more than 25 times.

    When I read this earlier today, I thought of my dear friend, Carol Sue, who was in the hospital and wasn’t expected to recover. We just received a text from her daughter that she “is at peace now” and I’m so happy she was a Christian who loved the Lord so that I can see her again one day. This is just one of many times that ODB devotions have been absolutely relevant for the day they are given–at least in my experience. I don’t know how that happens without God’s hand on all who contribute and the power of the Holy Spirit to bless us through you. Thanking God for using you all in this way. God bless and keep you all close.

    Heaven!How glorious!
    Eternity- that’s a looonnng time. No, that’s beyond time. And we get to spend it in the most amazing place that ever existed, with an “upgrade”. Jesus has been working on perfecting an already perfect place since he ascended over 2000 years ago. Look what he did in 6 days. Can you imagine what his 2000 year project must look like? Uuuuuh, I can’t wait to get there!
    But how we toil, and worry and get frustrated about things on this earth, that we are just passing through. Even if you live to be 1000 years, that’s only a dot compared to eternity. If we lived everyday in preparation for heaven, we wouldn’t be half as frustrated and stressed and worried as we sometimes are.
    
    Oh Lord help us to live each day getting ourselves and our world ready for eternity. Yes, our world- there are still so many people who are not ready – have you shared the Good News today?

        Awesome! That certainly is and should be enough. He is a wonderful Lord.
        Thank you for sharing such a simple, yet profound message.

        “What a glorious day that will be, when my Jesus I shall see. When I look upon His face, the One who saved me by His grace.
        When He takes me by the hand and leads me to the promise land, what a day, glorious day that will be.”
        
        And just think, we will have enough time to meet and get to know all the prophets of old and even all of our online friends that we’ve never met face to face here in this world.
        And best of all, we will be able to see Jesus in all of His glory and we will be able to praise Him with the heavenly language He so rightly deserves. Blessed be His Holy Name.

        Dear hjperez46, You are truly a miracle of God! with a purpose here on earth. For those of us who are chronically ill, life can at times be difficult and seem to stretch on forever before us without any seeming purpose. But, to God, our Father, who created us for a purpose, all things happen for our good in His timing,though we may not yet comprehend. Please, do not misunderstand. I’m not saying, God wanted us to be I’ll. I cannot fathom our Father’s intentions. But, what I am saying is that, He can turn all circumstances to our good,and for the good of others. Let me share a glorious story: My mom’s husband, my 2nd dad, was a good, quiet Christian. He became I’ll one summer and by the next he had died of numerous excruciating complications. Yet, he never complained, ever. Not ever. He was unfailingly kind, generous and cheerful to the last days of communication to those who cared for him; refusing all pain meds. In his last moments, he suddenly inclined his head,she said, as though listening intently and mumurring in reply, reached out his hand and began to appear like he was climbing a staircase. He’d been unconscious for days. But now, his face was infused with a serene and beautific light, with a contented smile upon his lips. The other arm looked as if it were clasped through, for support. As she watched her beloved climb the stairs to heaven, supported by Our Lord or angels, my dad passed over with that indescribable smile and infusing light all about him.
        You have a purpose here, to be a Prayer Warrior, for all those who are suffering without the comfort or knowledge, or salvation of Our Lord. To have the luxury to pray for those who are suffering without His comfort, I am constantly grateful. What joy, what bliss, to take my mind off my screaming body for a few moments or hours, while I pray for those who have no knowledge of the One True God! For their reception of His love, salvation and peace. I thank You Father God, Jesus my Savior, and my Counselor and Comforter for the innumerable times You have forgiven me, for my salvation, Your everlasting love and kindness. Truthfully, much more than I could ever deserve. I rejoice that You give it me! Until You are ready to call me home, help me to strive to be ready: to follow Your Word with joy and thankgiving; be faithful to Your will, and to occasionally give shouts of laughter at how truly blessed I am.AMEN AND AMEN!

    My mother and father have been with Jesus for may years now. Though I miss them and would love to pick up the phone to say hello, I am blessed to know what they enjoy in Heaven, and to be reminded that one day I will join them along with the great cloud of witnesses who have gone home over the centuries. The passage used for today’s meditation is like a picture postcard from Heaven. I imagine the note on the postcard says “This so amazing! You are going to love it.”

    Some people believe that Heaven is right here on earth, but this can never be true.
    There’s got to be a better place for believers in Christ, and that’s clear in God’s word.
    How I long for that place.
    My prayer is for those who do not know Christ, to come to know the truth, and be ready to spend eternity with Christ.
    O God, thank You for providing a Far Better life for us. Eternity with You. Only then can we experience true happiness. Worshiping and serving Christ forever. What a life to look forward to. Thank You Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.
