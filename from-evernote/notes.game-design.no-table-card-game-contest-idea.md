# No Table Card Game Contest Idea


3 slots per hand

Bottom, middle, top

To get benefits must have your worker on top

Top card gets points or converted

Last to play on fist gets points

Workers on one side points on other

Multiply cards

Positive and negative numbers

Maybe bonus/actions are on the worker cards so potentially 16 different bonus/actions

4 players each is a direction NESW?

Can an engine be built, feel more powerful

Bonuses/Actions

Move card clockwise to next available slot

Move card up a slot

Change player rotation

Totem pole

Toad'em Pole

Toad'em Pull

Toad'em Poll

Each fist is a monster

Cards are swords or weapons

The slots are footholds or areas to attack

There's a weak point that the player who gets the hit there it's the final blow and they get credit for killing the monster

Each fist is a moon/planet

Player need to conquer it, area control
