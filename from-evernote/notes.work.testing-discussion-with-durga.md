# Testing discussion with Durga


If a code is entered incorrectly by mistake, FACTs will verify it's incorrect but is there any error message that's sent back and displayed in Salesforce?
Maybe Aubrey knows this

Create settlement (a couple of minutes)
Let Karthik know to run job (5 minutes)
Shri runs job for Oracle finance (less than an hour)

Include Aubrey for End-to-End testing
