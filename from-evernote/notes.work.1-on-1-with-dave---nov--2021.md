# 1-on-1 with Dave - Nov. 2021


Provar training
Think-a-thon
DT Skill sharing

CC all the Delivery Leads on the Provar training
Work with folks to make sure they have everything installed
Add it to the Sharepoint calendar

Create the implementation plan,
December - being used
After this training, go back and do a card or 2 by this date
Now that you've gone through this, where do you think this can be applied
Do that immediately after the training
This is not optional, if I need help communicating this, let Dave know

Do this by a team by team
After the new year, let's get the other teammates involved

Reach out to Clint and see if he can cancel his trip,
there will be more complexity
Not value added at this point
Technical problems, etc. at the expense of everyone else

There would be a lot of logistics,

For the Perf review, be ready to show examples that showcase

Map out the goals if possible, maybe in a Spreadsheet

Review the Yearly goals

"Take care of your house first"

Delegate when needed and know when to say "no" when there are too many plates spinning

It's my responsibility to make sure everything gets tested right
