# Meet and Greet with Tamara 10/26/21


\- About her
    - Progressive and Amazon before Sherwin
\- About her role

\- Agile transformation

Agile transformation budget
\- We are getting that funding
\-
Defined the role for agile transformation
Still a work in a progress

Agile adoption is easier, we'll probably take this route first

3 different lanes
\- Programs that exist today, boost or refresher (lighter)
\- Waterfall teams that need to transform (heavier)
\- New product teams (lighter, because less teams)
    - Accelerate and Innovation

Standing up an agile transformation office that can accommodate all these different needs
\- Multiple roles
\- Support from the top is needed

Vocal passionate visual engagement

Consulting firm to help create the roadmap, to start iterating

Agile Execution Team
Agile coaches and trainers
Need to be helping the teams

Building and communicating the Case for Change

Think about the agile transformation, come back to her, figure out how I can get engaged with a time

45 minutes on calendar to talk with her about any questions, interested in my ideas, "If I were king for a day with agile?"
\- How would I want people to feel?
\- Who would I talk with?
\- What would I do?
\- Why would I do things?

Agile is 100% needed for the Digital Transformation
\- Direct communication
\- Passion
\- People who speak up
\- Will have crucial conversations

She focuses on outcomes and what success looks like

When having conversations about what I want to do,
I'm not indecisive, I'm interested in a lot of things
we need people who are interested in a lot of things and have learning agility
