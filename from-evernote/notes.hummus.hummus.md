# Hummus


<https://www.inspiredtaste.net/15938/easy-and-smooth-hummus-recipe/>

Doubled the recipe
No cumin or minced garlic
Added 3 tbsp of roasted red peppers
Added 3 tbsp of Cholua sauce
Added garlic powder and lemon juice to taste

You Will Need

**1 Can** chickpeas
**1/4 cup** fresh lemon juice (1 large lemon) or less

**1/4 cup** well-stirred tahini

1 small garlic clove, minced or Garlic Powder

**2 tablespoons** extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

Salt to taste

**Optional: 2 to 3 tablespoons** water 
**Optional: 2 to 3 tablespoons** Cholua hot sauce

Directions

    In the bowl of a food processor, combine the 1/4 cup of **tahini** and 1/4 cup of **lemon juice** and process for _**1 minute**_, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process for _**30 seconds**_ more. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the tahini, making the hummus smooth and creamy.

    Add the 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive **oil**, minced **garlic or garlic powder and** a **1/2 teaspoon of salt** to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for _**30 seconds**_, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another _**30 seconds**_ or until well blended.

    Open, drain, and rinse the **chickpeas**. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for _**1 minute**_. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth; _**1 to 2 minutes**_.

Add 3 tablespoons of Cholula
Add **3 tablespoons** roasted red peppers
    Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.

    Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week.
