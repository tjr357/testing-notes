# Game Ideas 1


Futuristic Business Hackers:
Geek Mafia/Cowboy Bebop/ Mafia/ Yakuza/ Ninjas
Chinese dude(Glen from The Walking Dead/Aang)
Black dude(dreds)
Mexican/Spanish dude(Machete, Mexico Trilogy)
Main dude (Spike/Neo)

2D game:
Metroid, fast paced?, lock on aim feature, portals)
Ninja/alien portal guy

2D game:
Metroidvania meets Avatar elements(air, fire, earth/metals, water, grass)
Combine elements (Alchemy/Minecraft)?

Game where you drink a shot and you can "hack" your mind and alter the way the character interacts with the game, only so much time to alter? Unlock your body's ful potential like Limitless?

Another Limitless idea: take a pill, basically let's you hack your body and mind, your body has an OS inside of it?

Story about a guy waking up and he's falling from an airplane and has to figure out everything (Bourne Identity like, tie in hacking?)

FP(S) that's like a 2D platformer but you can only move forwards, backwards and jump? don't know if it's been done before?

Dinosaur geek, hackers

2D platformer, sports super hero, throws baseballs, hits balls, catches, dunks, tackles, baseball slide, skateboard,golf shoots basketballs, slapshot puck, wrestling moves?, different jerseys = other powers and abilities , kicks, spins, hurdles, climbs walls, Story: he's at a baseball game and catches the new hr record ball, gets mobbed on the way home, ends up with powers and picks up more powers and levels up, unlock an outfit after u play with them for a level or so like in SMB

2D Platformer with bikes/cycles/Uniracers and a shooter!

2D platformerbeatem and shootem up and have aliens, pirates, robots, cowboys, etc.... And each one has different abilities and specials with co\-op play, Alien-Hominid meets Castle Crashers!

Shmup where the ship has to navigate a maze

Game involving barcodes or data matrix bar codes

2D game platformer starts off basic Atari-like gfx, NESgfx, vector gfx, 3D model gfx, more abilities and upgrades as u progress

2D game platformer where as u side scroll the level layout spells out a story, and u unlock missing words of the story?

Either that or an educational? Food game 2d game, eat bad foods become more powerful but tired and slow eat healthy become weak but faster and more energetic

Food + Alchemy

2D game tied in with CLI/hacking user types and the character moves accordingly every time user hits Return the character drops down a level??

2D game boy goes on adventure collects parts to build go cart, space ship, airplane, sub, main basis is a platformerÂ  collect things too?

Game where you recruit nerds and geeks, different levels of geekiness like classes, hackers programmers web designers network admins system admins modders, etc. kind of like an rts game?

2d platformer puzzle where character can shoot his arms and legs, or leave his arms and legs to access certain areas, and he can't complete the level until he gets them back, co-op might work better with that?

A game where you are a hacker and you are fighting and making your way through levels but there are terminals for you to hack in. First you have to play a mini-game of sorts and actually hack your way into the system. Once you are in the system you have a limited amount of time to complete the level or give up. If you feel like you aren't going to complete the level you have to jump out of the system. Later on you will be able to save your progress in the system, but at the start you would have to start all over inside the system. The game would have a different look when you are inside of the system and the gameplay mechanics would be different from the main game. Say the main portion of the game was a 2D side scroller stealth shooter mashup and the mini-game to hack into would be a mini-game like a light cycle or something like that. The in-system part of the game would be a race against the clock to collect certain pieces of data or even immobilize the enemies. Definitely a WIP! Needs to be more clear and concise.

2D game where your character has to work out to upgrade, even if you fail you're still gaining XP, you have to do exercises to stay fit and become stronger. to kill time you(grinding) do some pushups, lifting, leg exercises, etc. Jump higher, run faster, stronger punches & kicks, better agility, etc.

Real time or turn based platformer choose your path and let it play out like Frozen Synapse

2D shooter platform where the ammo is tetriminos and the enemies corresond accordingly

2D platformer, there's alot of negativity in the world, the character runs through it as fast as they can and when their run is done they can look at the world map and determine what needs to be fixed, they can plan out a route and then go back through the world and try to complete it, the trick is they always have to be moving forward so you try and choose the path that will cause the most amount of good

2D platformer coop where the characters are robots? But they are attached by a rope/chain and they have to solve puzzles, momentum comes into play, rope/chain has different states?

A game that involves parasites and makes it fun to take over a host maybe involve hacking? Parasite Paradise? The game starts off with one "bug" has a certain ablility and in each world there is a new "boss" that the "bug" can absorb giving it new abilities. Have land, air, sea, and different powers from each bug. 2D platformer fast paced, alien/futuristic/neon looking the bugs are circular kind of like a wheel, they almost look mechanical or robotic

2D platformer that has the character start off with all the abilities but after each stage or world they lose one ability, the game adjusts to this somehow therefore making the game more difficult, what would be the incentive to progress though? The effects that the boss or world have on the character take a power away and maybe a bonus would be after you beat the game you can revisit each stage/world with all powers or "turn on" certain ones
