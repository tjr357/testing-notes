# Worker Placement Game Mechanic Idea


3 ring sizes for workers. The first player to take a spot, must use the smallest worker ring. Another player may choose that spot and place the medium ring and another player may use the largest ring.

The spot can be used 3 times. 1st person gets biggest reward but the bigger rings get something good too.

Could also make it so, the last ring to be added can be picked up and signify the turn order.

Maybe they're blobs, they can grow and shrink
