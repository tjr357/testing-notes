# Card Game Idea


Trick taking

Drafting

Set collection Rummy

Start with 3 cards

Flip 5 cards over like a river

Every player must take 1 card, either from the river or the deck

The card in the middle of the river is the trump suit

Players will choose a card to keep pass their hand to the left and repeat until there's 1 card left in the hand

Then each player plays their remaining card face up, the winning player of that trick, chooses trump or the trump is the middle card

Then each player picks up their cards they chose from the drafting phase

Then play a regular trick taking game

With the winner of each trick leading the next

Aces are high

Shuffle and deal again increasing the number dealt by 1

Repeat until the round begins with 7 cards per player

Keep track of the tricks win

The player with the most tricks wins
