# DE15956 - Discussion


Lowes Audit
Product Details field is not displayed correctly
Discrepancy Comments

Finance let GSC know there was this issue and GSC (TJ) let us know it was broke.

On the Business Objects report, the "Audit Product - Discrepancy Comments" field was being overwritten by Boomi because it was labeled as a Date field.
Dave confirmed the text I wrote in the test data was there and not overwritten.

We agreed to push this forward and Dave will run the BO report in Prod. If there are any issues, let Yogi know asap.
