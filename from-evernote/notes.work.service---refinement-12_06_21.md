# Service - Refinement 12/06/21


Rush batches are not needed for Garland

Each site will have their own approvals

Charlotte and Covington will be combined

All schedulers are notified and it's there that they can choose which Cases to Approve

S65833
GI Purchasers
\- Kate will add the AC's after the refinement meeting

S65829
\- a name will be added to the group

DE16288
\- We want to rule out this is a SF issue

Anytime a request is sent from the desktop or mobile device internally, it's duplicating the Case
