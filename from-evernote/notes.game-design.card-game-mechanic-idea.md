# Card Game Mechanic Idea


Based on the Bible passage "...the stone the builders rejected, will become the cornerstone..."

Players have cards that are double sided (up/down) originally they have a power or value.
They must discard and when they do so, that card becomes twice as powerful or valuable.
This discarded card is available to the next player or the other players.
