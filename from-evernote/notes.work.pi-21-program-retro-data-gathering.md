# PI 21 Program Retro Data Gathering


```
Attendees:
- Ashley
- Chip
- Bill
- Jenny
Asking the SM's to hold individual retros with teams and gathering data to use for input in a larger program retro. This has been the most effective method in the past.
I'll do the retro for SAND
Schedule mine later, so I can be a fly a wall to another retro
Use Outlook to schedule, find their distribution email address
Ashley will meet with the PO's of each team
Schedule meeting for after 10/11
Predefined format
Ashley to send prelim email out on Monday
What went well, not so well, new ideas
Scope: all of PI 21
Ashley would like whoever does the TCS retro should work with Dan the DL/SM
```
