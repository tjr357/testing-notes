# Game Ideas 5


3D game co-op team components, work together to defeat the enemy using a single ball, players pass the ball around and target the enemies weak spots, the ball has physics too, there will only be one ball at a time unless there's power ups

3D dodge ball game

3D or 2D THPS meets Metroidvania

Remember Crossfire?! The game you played in the 90's with all the BB's and the marble plastic pieces you had to hit to score into the other players goal? Have a 3D arena combat game where each player has a set amount of ammo (BB's) in their supply bag. The supply bag is connected to a shooter/vacuum (like the Ghostbusters Proton Pack). The BB's get shot out of the shooter and they stay littered all over the map. The players can vacuum up all the BB's to get ammo. The maps could be laid out so the BB's get collected in different pools, traverse along grooves in the map, traverse a track/rail/pneumatics system. There could be different modes where it's more like Crossfire and you have to score an object. If possible have the BB's physically shoot through the hose from the bag out the shooter and be sucked up through the hose into the bag. The idea is that there will always be reusable ammo. Add power-ups to make the BB's explosive, electric, more bouncy, faster, homing-like. Jet packs, speed, shield, etc. power-ups.

2D side/isometric/top down ball game. People sitting in chairs use their legs to move backwards, which is faster but harder to catch. Move forwards gives better aim but slower. Pass harder for a more direct pass and pass lighter for a more lofty pass.Â
