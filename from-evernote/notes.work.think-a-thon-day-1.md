We can disagree without being disagreeable
Find common ground, we can make progress
When we listen it leads to better disccussions, inclusiveness
Truly diverse teams will do amazing things

Write a discussion guide
It's more of a guide, have a natural flow when interviewing

Eco-conscious painting is our focus but there are outer influences that can also be discussed

Let the participant lead, have a natural conversation
they are the expert, don't correct them if they're wrong
uncomfortable silence is good

Interview
Dan
\- He's more concious of being more environmentally sustainable
\- Learned in grade school
\- His father would bring canvas tote bags to the store
\- Recycling at home and in the office when possible
\- Encouraged guests at party to recycle
\- Anything that can be reused
\- Sharing resources, ex. yard edger, there are friends who have things like that
\- Don't need to be cluttering landfills
\- Has Amazon ship products on "Amazon day" to save on packaging, shipping
\- Don't need huge big bold actions
\- What small tweaks can we do that will be more sustainable
\- Wishes there was glass recycling in community, he's not going to save his glass bottles and then drop it off at another community
\- Not going to go out of way and be crazy about it
\- Planning
    - What's available in home that can be reused
    - Not just a financial reason
    - What paint, what color, consumer reports - what's rated highly for them
    - What's available in community, stores availability
    - Not fully aware of what sustainability is available with paints unless it's clearly stated, open to hearing about it though
    - How much paint will be needed, can always go buy more

Brad
\- climate change is pushed in our faces, so we might have lost the meaning behind it
\- from NY didn't have a car, in Portland now moved, does he need car right now?
\- Always willing to learn more about being more environmentally concious, GRETA links?
\- Going to sites that are giving information vs. a site that will be bold about their agenda. NASA
\- Laundry soap, biodegradable bags, glass recycling, weekly compost, find things that are fully recyclable
\- Reuse bottles when possible
\- Walking instead of taking bus
\- What food buying, packages
\- Trying to buy only what's needed at the time
\- Careful about what goes in the ground/water
\- Being more concious
\- Enjoys restaurants, but they don't recycle super well
\- Looked at what paint was available in the house
\- Furnature
\- Planning
    - Safer paint (expensive)
    - Clothe
    - Trapped water to be disposed safely at a site
    - Research
    - Surprises
        - Flat paint is better on the environment

Recap:
Paint is really confusing
QR code on can could convey information

Day 1 Regroup:

Day 1 was a hypothesis

Go deeper, figure out the why
Try not to literally just translate
Look for themes that can be surfaced
We don't have time to do additional research, use your best guess

The How might we
Think differently

What's your hesitation, I'd like to understand you better
Reward the behavior you want to see, call those things out
