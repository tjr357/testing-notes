# RPG's: Why CC likes them


Some things I think I've really enjoyed about RPG's, not sure if this is what you're looking for:

*   Sense of adventure and excitement (you don't know what's going to happen)
*   Collaboration, but also, can you trust your fellow adventurers? Adds levels of communication, collaboration, and negotiation. Are you a team player, or a lone wolf?
*   Ability to explore your character/build them out based on set rules for the game that give you room within them to play to who your character is. Like with world building for a book, having set rules or truths to the game makes it easier to play and buy-in (a wizard may be able to pick up a bow and arrow but realistically won't be a marksman the first time without spells aiding him, but this sets forth the opportunity to be creative and see how players can puzzle through things).
*   Puzzles and creativity, not everything has to be about action, it can be about exploring places, using the right tools, or asking the right questions (example: When Gandalf and the crew have to puzzle out opening the door and it's really straight forward but not plainly laid out)
*   Ability to flesh out the world/your character - partial customizability gives a sense of ownership and immersion
*   Good world building - There can be gaps players can fill, but going along with the "rules" of the world, good structure (how contained is the world, what exists, are there patterns that can be set up to generate the core things (people, places, etc.) or are these set? (patterns and structure help allow for more customization because they set forth rules to follow in generating new things) Is there currency, how complicated is the exchange rate, is everything the same language, etc.) Knowing these can change the tone of the game. Maybe it's a small village populated with talking horses and they have to band together against an evil cat, or maybe it's a group of adventurer's traveling the ocean sailing between kingdoms. It can be as big or small as you want, but having structure makes it real. But an example of patterns allowing for chance and change would be if you have 3 types of nemeses of differing levels, and when you enter a room or spring a trap, you roll to see how many are generated and of what types, or roll to see how many cards you pull and those x number of cards could be any medley of obstacles, small to large. The structure of the world doesn't have to be thorough or massive, just sturdy and as much as the tone of the game needs.

Good luck!! That sounds so exciting!

You can also approach it a little bit like system design - what are the components, constraints (theme, game mechanics, etc.), how do the different parts of the system relate or interact, and start mapping it out conceptually. You can focus bottom-up (what is the underlying structure, general outline, game mechanics/rule set, and then work to add details in) or top-down (focus on theme, goals, overall ideas, and then work backwards to see what works and build out rules and structure to support). I think a little bit of both and meeting in the middle helps, and you can also bring in people to brainstorm ideas for the different areas and help build out the world building elements with you.Â 

Ooh! If you do that, you could explore/tie in ideas from those "Choose your own adventure"/Goosebumps books where you could have options and different results per option dependent on the character, stats, preceding actions, and more. There's going to be a lot of branching, but writing out some outline documentation could help, especially with defining high level consequences or reactions.
