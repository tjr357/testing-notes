# Pluralsight/Udemy Role Channel Review Kickoff


How the role card will look in Pluralsight

Look at the courses and review them

Pluralsight and Udemy full access

Udemy will be externally linked from within Pluralsight

SkillIQ - there will be badges, etc.
We could run challenges if we want but that would

SkillIQ typically only take 15 minutes, if we want to check out

Sherwin way type stuff can be added to the courses

Buffet of learning, people will need guidance

1 license for each PS, Udemy
