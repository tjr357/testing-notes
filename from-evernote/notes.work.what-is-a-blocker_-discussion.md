# What is a Blocker? Discussion


Blocker - What is it good for?
Meeting with Chip and Dave

Are we on the same page?
The team, the program

Chip
\- Impediment - something slows us down
\- Blocker - team cannot work on it at all

We need to ask an external team how long it's going to take, and it exceeds that time, it should be Blocked
\- Blockers should stop time

What does a blocker signify, why have them?

We're going to be interacting with a lot of teams

Do we place a task on

Dave
Impediment - In-progress and slow
Blocker - no progress is being made, no matter who's working on
