# Red AAT Retro - 10/25/21


Attendance:
\- Tomas, Jenny, Kate, Shruthi, Gerry, Rajesh, Steve

The team was told they would be reserved 20% time to learn AAT, but things were overloaded

Sprints are loaded over more than 100%, over 150%
\- Jenny was discussing this with Dave

It was not a concious decison to not do AAT, but rather because we're "date driven" we decided to work the way we normally work

Where is Dave R.?!?!?!?!?!?

Keeping people busy with separate cards happens to be the goal

Jenny will try to NOT overload the work for the team
