# Heist get away driving board game


City map
Outer edges are escape routes 
Cops vs. robbers
2 vs. 2 
Cops try to block robbers from escaping
Lay traps, flank, etc.
Robbers are trying to escape to their hidden hide out, it changes each game where it's at
Mechanics
Robbers program their next 5 moves
Drive straight, turns, stop, lay trap or use ability
Cops have a little more of an advantage, different mechanics moving their cars with dice rolls or action points? Lay traps

Non-violent, think Bonkers gadgets and stuff
