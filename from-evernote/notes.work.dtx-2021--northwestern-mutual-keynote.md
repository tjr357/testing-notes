# DTX 2021- Northwestern Mutual Keynote


Looked at how she interacted with other companies

It's not about technology
it's about transformation
connectedness, availability

People and Culture
treat people with respect and dignity
transparency
honest
know that we're all smart
give people time to digest, and help them understand how they play a role
give them the needed resources
give people incentive to help in the upscale process
give people opps to evolve their skills

trying to encourage new behaviors, caused them to lose sight with their old ones
don't throw out everything that worked for the sake of new

know the direction that you want to head in

HR
recruited innovation
retained talent

Milwaukee Tech Club
encourage people to share within community
advocates became employees
they also have a Women in Technology group
    - deep dives in small groups leadership, personal skills

Communication
how to communicate effectively without causing fear?
they became more transparent and more frequent in communications
early communication
respect those that did not want to be a part of the upscale
consistent up and down
give employees avenues to submit questions and let their voices be heard
they have quarterly engagement surveys and take action!

Business

Governance & work in take
keep it aligned, keep a pulse on all products and projects going on
change from funding to a value mindset, things that you thought were important probably won't seem as important as before
what does value mean? - can you measure value?
value = benefit minus the cost

Technology
they were laser focused on team autonomy, they lost the ability to have some patterns
it slowed them down
invest in documenting golden pass, focus on shared services, shared services and center of excellences
autonomy + guidelines/guard rails

they eliminated time logging?

when compliance takes priority, values may shift and it needs to be flexible

Take aways
\- always start with business capabilities and then seek alignment, id funding gaps
\- have a really strong vision, transparent and communicate, needs to have a strategy
\- have product vision and align, work with change management
\- always look for the balance, 4 pillars, need to circle through them all and make sure they're updating
