# Worker Placement Bird and Egg Game Mechanic Idea


WP mechanic with a bird leaving an egg behind. But the egg laying is optional.

The egg is hidden, from other players and they won't know until that bird is removed.

Leaving an egg behind, occupies that spot but if another player chooses that spot, there's a negative effect. But positive for the original egg owner.
