# GitHub Discussion with Srini and Chris J. - 1/4/22


Migrate GitHub from on prem to actual GitHub

GitHub actions instead of Jenkins will be used

GitHub cloud is 6 months ahead of on-prem

If Provar does not fully support GitHub Actions, we can write our own actions

Jenkins and on-prem will always be available

Get everyone to setup a GitHub.com account
Setup accounts in GitHub.com

use lowercase for the repo name and dashes
