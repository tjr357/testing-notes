# Discussion with Dave


I should have documented testing S63845 more Thoroughly

Think about taking screenshots and putting them in a document to tell the testing story
document, document, document

Take notes in previous meetings so it's not a surprise when it's ready for testing

Thoroughly read a card and understand it before testing.

Bringing in enhancements will need to be brought in at a just-in-time basis

Make sure I know the process before executing them, when I'm filling in

It was weird that I brought up bringing in 2 enhancements, that's not the normal process and it through everyone for a loop
