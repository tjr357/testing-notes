# Discussion with Dave 10/25/21


Dave R. will choose what folks to include for Provar training

Is there a gap in automation testing with TCS?

Let each delivery lead choose

Dave will reach out to each DL and discuss

We would have to get guest access for each person,
doublecheck with them if they think it's valuable
\- Guest access to the Internet
\- Find place for them to work
\- Have video access
\- Could they stay in their hotel and then I meet them and they don't have to come into the office

\- Building services,
or HR Leanne

Town Hall
\- Training
    - What's happening
    - Who's involved
    - Champions
\- Plan going forward
\- Reiterate why we're using Provar
