# Game Idea


Sliding puzzle game but with a skateboarder.
Isometric
Swipe in either 4 directions
Ramps, grind rails, half-pipes
Goal is to get to certain point
Get there in the least amount of moves but get bonus for taking “longer” route to get tricks
Multi-leveled for stair rails and gaps
Combo system, after a trick is done on each object, tap the screen to initiate manual/revert
Like in the Friday the 13th puzzle game

*    have police officers that stop you from skating
    

*    chain reaction events
