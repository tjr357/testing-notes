# Note conflict Game Ideas


Futuristic Business Hackers:
Geek Mafia/Cowboy Bebop/ Mafia/ Yakuza/ Ninjas
Chinese dude(Glen from The Walking Dead/Aang)
Black dude(dreds)
Mexican/Spanish dude(Machete, Mexico Trilogy)
Main dude (Spike/Neo)

Combine elements (Alchemy/Minecraft)?

Game where you drink a shot and you can "hack" your mind and alter the way the character interacts with the game, only so much time to alter? Unlock your body's ful potential like Limitless?

Another Limitless idea: take a pill, basically let's you hack your body and mind, your body has an OS inside of it?

Story about a guy waking up and he's falling from an airplane and has to figure out everything (Bourne Identity like, tie in hacking?)

FP(S) that's like a 2D platformer but you can only move forwards, backwards and jump? don't know if it's been done before?

2D game (Metroid, fast paced?, lock on aim feature, portals)
Ninja/alien portal guy

2D game, Metroidvania meets Avatar elements(air,fire,earth/metals, water, grass)

Dinosaur geek, hackers

Game where u drink a shot and u can "hack" ur mind and alter the way the character interacts with the game, only so much time to alter? Unlock your body's full potential like Limitless?

2D platformer, sports super hero, throws baseballs, hits balls, catches, dunks, tackles, baseball slide, skateboard,golf shoots basketballs, slapshot puck, wrestling moves?, different jerseys = other powers and abilities , kicks, spins, hurdles, climbs walls, Story: he's at a baseball game and catches the new hr record ball, gets mobbed on the way home, ends up with powers and picks up more powers and levels up, unlock an outfit after u play with them for a level or so like in SMB

2D Platformer with bikes/cycles/Uniracers and a shooter!

2D platformerbeatem and shootem up and have aliens, pirates, robots, cowboys, etc.... And each one has different abilities and specials with co\-op play, Alien-Hominid meets Castle Crashers!

Shmup where the ship has to navigate a maze
Game involving barcodes or data matrix bar codes

2D game platformer starts off basic Atari-like gfx, NESgfx, vector gfx, 3D model gfx, more abilities and upgrades as u progress

2D game platformer where as u side scroll the level layout spells out a story, and u unlock missing words of the story?

Either that or an educational? Food game 2d game, eat bad foods become more powerful but tired and slow eat healthy become weak but faster and more energetic

Food + Alchemy

2D game tied in with CLI/hacking user types and the character moves accordingly every time user hits Return the character drops down a level??

2D game boy goes on adventure collects parts to build go cart, space ship, airplane, sub, main basis is a platformer  collect things too?

Game where you recruit nerds and geeks, different levels of geekiness like classes, hackers programmers web designers network admins system admins modders, etc. kind of like an rts game?

2d platformer puzzle where character can shoot his arms and legs, or leave his arms and legs to access certain areas, and he can't complete the level until he gets them back, co-op might work better with that?

A game where you are a hacker and you are fighting and making your way through levels but there are terminals for you to hack in. First you have to play a mini-game of sorts and actually hack your way into the system. Once you are in the system you have a limited amount of time to complete the level or give up. If you feel like you aren't going to complete the level you have to jump out of the system. Later on you will be able to save your progress in the system, but at the start you would have to start all over inside the system. The game would have a different look when you are inside of the system and the gameplay mechanics would be different from the main game. Say the main portion of the game was a 2D side scroller stealth shooter mashup and the mini-game to hack into would be a mini-game like a light cycle or something like that. The in-system part of the game would be a race against the clock to collect certain pieces of data or even immobilize the enemies. Definitely a WIP! Needs to be more clear and concise.

2D game where your character has to work out to upgrade, even if you fail you're still gaining XP, you have to do exercises to stay fit and become stronger. to kill time you(grinding) do some pushups, lifting, leg exercises, etc. Jump higher, run faster, stronger punches & kicks, better agility, etc.

Real time platformer choose your path and let it play out like Frozen Synapse

2D shooter platform where the ammo is tetriminos and the enemies corresond accordingly

2D platformer, there's alot of negativity in the world, the character runs through it as fast as they can and when their run is done they can look at the world map and determine what needs to be fixed, they can plan out a route and then go back through the world and try to complete it, the trick is they always have to be moving forward so you try and choose the path that will cause the most amount of good

2D platformer coop where the characters are robots? But they are attached by a rope/chain and they have to solve puzzles, momentum comes into play, rope/chain has different states?

A game that involves parasites and makes it fun to take over a host maybe involve hacking? Parasite Paradise? The game starts off with one "bug" has a certain ablility and in each world there is a new "boss" that the "bug" can absorb giving it new abilities. Have land, air, sea, and different powers from each bug. 2D platformer fast paced, alien/futuristic/neon looking the bugs are circular kind of like a wheel, they almost look mechanical or robotic

2D platformer that has the character start off with all the abilities but after each stage or world they lose one ability, the game adjusts to this somehow therefore making the game more difficult, what would be the incentive to progress though? The effects that the boss or world have on the character take a power away and maybe a bonus would be after you beat the game you can revisit each stage/world with all powers or "turn on" certain ones

Mix a Space Invaders type game with Breakout, the enemies shoot at you and you have to defend with your "paddle"

Super Stickman Golf + Frozen Synapse + Worms but with ninjas, instead of golf holes there's a base to infiltrate and different enemies to take out along the way, have the player choose different power is before starting the mission

Have two stick figures throwing a ball back and forth, they can move around and jump. Maybe work in platforming, multi-player support. Button sensitive throwing determines how far the ball goes. Work in different sports mechanics, like alley-oop the ball to another player and have them dunk it. Throw in tricks. Take it further and add something like dodgeball death match or a water balloon fight where there's splashes everywhere. Add in baseball bat mechanics, the player can run and scoop up the ball on the fly and catch the ball in midair and then throw it. If the sports mechanics are thrown in have a modifier button where the player dons a sports uniform e.g. throw on basketball shorts and jersey and head band and gives them the ability to dribble, shoot, and dunk the ball. Have different objects in the game that alter the ball and player physics e.g. trampolines, speed up strips, portals. I can see this being a really fun silly game that's easy to pickup and learn and play. Use scalable vector graphics and cartoon like graphics, think NBA Jam stickmen team. Have different colors scheme and character customization. 2D

2D platformer where there's a timer and the world is slowly changing, when the time runs out the player can morph if they want to to adapt to the level? Needs work

2D platformer with a character who has a skateboard its his weapon, He can ride it, kick it at enemies, grind things, hippie jumps, use it to make tough jumps?

2D/3D platformer where you're a wrestler main emphasis is fast paced always on the move, grapple wrestling moves and high flying, give it a comic type crazy vibe, moving power bomb, choke slams, body slams, spears, suplexes, flying elbow and leg drop, throw in ladders, tables and other weapons, hurricarnas, very arcady

Have a 2D action platformer where the screen is locked in place horizontally but they can move upwards. After they reach the next screen they have the option to upgrade their character and weapons, the gimmick is though if they fall back down a level then they lose those upgrades. Maybe have a mode where the enemies remain tougher even if the player falls down?

Editable/Edible a game where you're a creature who can build/create stuff which is where the editable comes into play, and then the creature can eat their creations for points or ammo or something like that, hence the edible. 

Have a game where it's an entire HTML5 Web Page and the user interacts with it, so the Page literally scrolls up and down and the character navigates the map

Alien Ninja type game, futuristic and ancient alien, logos, scripts, language, barefoot ninja looking character SF Ryu looking, bandana, has a tail
Abilities: wall jump, shoot things, melee combat, break through barriers, double jump, climbing, sliding, dashing, air dash
Bring in different elements: fire, water, air/wind, earth, electricity and they can be combined
Futuristic theme: fire - red neon, water - blue neon, etc.
Fire levels can be cooled down by water, fire melts ice, spot to hack gives you level map
Different weapons combined with elements: Whips - fire, earth, electric; Shurkiens - electric; Sword - ice, electric; Bow & Arrow - ice picks
Minigame to get from 1 world/level to another, regenerative ammo/energy that enemies drop (Metroid like)
Bonus levels: air launch level - collect as many things as possible; vine swinging - chase level; water surfing - chase level; time base challenges; puzzle level where you burn down vines to escape

a method to create a game world bc i can't draw, build objects in the real world and take a picture of them and then use the objects as an outline for levels?

Have a 2D platformer or topdown game where the player can see the entire level first and they can add certain things to it to help them throughout the level. Think of adding things like in a tower defense game where you set everything first then the action takes place. Enemy patterns will change dynamically if the player fails to keep things fresh and the types of objects will change as well as maybe the level design? The weapons can be chosen too. So in a sense the player will have to remember what they put down in a level so when they arrive to that piece they will be ready for it? 

Have a stealth game where one part is completely stealth, sneaking around and then when you decide to kill an enemy it's an all out balls to the wall Contra type shooter?

Have a 2D platformer where in order to defeat the boss you have to add blocks to the enemy, there is a certain type of block displayed on screen that you have to make the enemy into in order to defeat it.

Create a game that revolves around sending "notes" back and forth, maybe asynchronous. These notes could be asking for help like sending in someone to help or sending in for a new weapon? 

A shmup/side scroller shooter where the ammo you shoot gets looped back to you in order to recycle, think of in bowling when your ball is returned to you but the ammo would have new abilities based on the enemies?

Create a game where each letter in the English alphabet is a platforming type element eventually add special characters. ex. a U = halfpipe, N = zipline, A = ramp, W = saws, M = pit

Dougs Game/Story Idea{
Alright, I was going to wait to tell you this tomorrow, but I think I know how to incorporate it all into a rough plot.  The ship you pilot has been sent to Earth from an obliterated colony in space in the near future.  The ship was constructed from the same technology that an alien superweapon used to wipe out the colony.  In an attempt to wipe out every last bit of its own technology which it fears is a threat, the alien superweapon is approaching Earth to finish off the last ship.  The weapon itself however, is guarded by these Guardian weapons, resembling ancient alien deities which were known for their ability to control the elements.  The only way to destroy the alien superweapon is to destroy the Guardians that protect it by docking your ship into them, and as the player, destroying them from the inside-out.  The final battle with the alien superweapon would be a variation of both ship and player combat In order to go from Guardian to Guardian, your have to pilot your ship through a shmup level.  Your ship has basic weaponry, but it can fire special attacks based on the elements derived from the alien technology.  When you dock at a ship, your player hacks the Guardian in order to destroy it, and the enemies (or defenses) you kill while inside will not only level up your weapons, but the enemies will drop energy based on the weapon you killed them with and their nature, which you can then use at the end of each level to power up your ships weapons.  The actual player combat represents hacking the Guardians, and the player must not only destroy the final computer program boss within each Guardian, but must then upgrade their ship to do battle with the Guardian shmup bosses as well.  THE END

Hahaha I'm glad you like it.  :)  Minus Ninjas, it incorporates everything we talked about, and in a way that makes sense and combines both ancient and futuristic worlds.  Maybe both the ship and the player can have a standard weapon, and in the player's case, it's a sword.  It does the absolute minimum base damage to all enemies, but he can wield it like a Ninja.  ;)

Alternate to the main story, main character escapes from the alien colony/ship?

Have an alienistic tribal like language and have there be secret messages throughout the game, leave it up to the player to unlock the different letters and figure out how to decipher the secret language. The hidden letters could be hidden in levels like KONG in DKC or have the player do something to unlock them.

2D platformer where you type in commands that controls your character like Quadrilateral Cowboy, would be lots of trial and error

2D platformer where the gimmick is a hookshot and zipline between buildings, if there are enemies they can be grabbed like Scorpion's "Get over here!" move. Faster paced run, jump, vertical and horizontal. A faster paced Bionic Commando in a sense.

2D platformer where the character carries around an object and it means something to him, he can throw it, ride it, use it to solve puzzles, defeat enemies with it, etc. think of when in Super Mario world holding a koopa shell

2D side scroller where the character is attached to a rope like a tow line in wake boarding, the character is being pulled throughout the level

Have a game where 1 player is in control of a character and the other player is creating the waves of enemies, a more linear 3rd person game

Have a Point and Click game solving puzzles. Each object in the environment means something and can be used to solve the puzzle. Say the player needs to spell out something like MOUSE, they will find a Map, Orange, Umbrella, Snail, and an Envelope to spell it? IDK

2d platformer where the character uses an umbrella as a weapon, use it to float down, upside down to zip line,  use it as a shield, use it as a boat to cross over water
