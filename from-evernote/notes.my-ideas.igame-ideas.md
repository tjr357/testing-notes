# IGame Ideas


Futuristic Business Hackers:
Geek Mafia/Cowboy Bebop/ Mafia/ Yakuza/ Ninjas
Chinese dude(Glen from The Walking Dead/Aang)
Black dude(dreds)
Mexican/Spanish dude(Machete, Mexico Trilogy)
Main dude (Spike/Neo)

2D game:
Metroid, fast paced?, lock on aim feature, portals)
Ninja/alien portal guy

2D game:
Metroidvania meets Avatar elements(air, fire, earth/metals, water, grass)
Combine elements (Alchemy/Minecraft)?

2D platformer: Sports super hero, throws baseballs, hits balls, catches, dunks, tackles, baseball slide, shoots basketballs, slapshot puck, wrestling moves? different jerseys = other powers and abilities, kicks, spins, hurdles, climbs walls, Story: he's at a baseball game and catches the new HR record ball, gets mobbed on the way home, ends up with powers and picks up more powers and levels up

Game where you drink a shot and you can "hack" your mind and alter the way the character interacts with the game, only so much time to alter? Unlock your body's ful potential like Limitless?

Another Limitless idea: take a pill, basically let's you hack your body and mind, your body has an OS inside of it?

Story about a guy waking up and he's falling from an airplane and has to figure out everything (Bourne Identity like, tie in hacking?)

FP(S) that's like a 2D platformer but you can only move forwards, backwards and jump? don't know if it's been done before?

2D game (Metroid, fast paced?, lock on aim feature, portals)
Ninja/alien portal guy

2D game, Metroidvania meets Avatar elements(air,fire,earth/metals, water, grass)

Dinosaur geek, hackers

Game where u drink a shot and u can "hack" ur mind and alter the way the character interacts with the game, only so much time to alter? Unlock your body's full potential like Limitless?

2D platformer, sports super hero, throws baseballs, hits balls, catches, dunks, tackles, baseball slide, skateboard,golf shoots basketballs, slapshot puck, wrestling moves?, different jerseys = other powers and abilities , kicks, spins, hurdles, climbs walls, Story: he's at a baseball game and catches the new hr record ball, gets mobbed on the way home, ends up with powers and picks up more powers and levels up, unlock an outfit after u play with them for a level or so like in SMB

2D Platformer with bikes/cycles/Uniracers and a shooter!

2D platformer beatem and shootem up and have aliens, pirates, robots, cowboys, etc.... And each one has different abilities and specials with co\-op play, Alien-Hominid meets Castle Crashers!

Shmup where the ship has to navigate a maze
Game involving barcodes or data matrix bar codes

2D game platformer starts off basic Atari-like gfx, NES gfx, vector gfx, 3D model gfx, more abilities and upgrades as u progress

2D game platformer where as u side scroll the level layout spells out a story, and u unlock missing words of the story?

Either that or an educational? Food game 2d game, eat bad foods become more powerful but tired and slow eat healthy become weak but faster and more energetic

Food + Alchemy

2D game tied in with CLI/hacking user types and the character moves accordingly every time user hits Return the character drops down a level??

2D game boy goes on adventure collects parts to build go cart, space ship, airplane, sub, main basis is a platformer  collect things too?

Game where you recruit nerds and geeks, different levels of geekiness like classes, hackers programmers web designers network admins system admins modders, etc. kind of like an rts game?

2d platformer puzzle where character can shoot his arms and legs, or leave his arms and legs to access certain areas, and he can't complete the level until he gets them back, co-op might work better with that?

A game where you are a hacker and you are fighting and making your way through levels but there are terminals for you to hack in. First you have to play a mini-game of sorts and actually hack your way into the system. Once you are in the system you have a limited amount of time to complete the level or give up. If you feel like you aren't going to complete the level you have to jump out of the system. Later on you will be able to save your progress in the system, but at the start you would have to start all over inside the system. The game would have a different look when you are inside of the system and the gameplay mechanics would be different from the main game. Say the main portion of the game was a 2D side scroller stealth shooter mashup and the mini-game to hack into would be a mini-game like a light cycle or something like that. The in-system part of the game would be a race against the clock to collect certain pieces of data or even immobilize the enemies. Definitely a WIP! Needs to be more clear and concise.

2D game where your character has to work out to upgrade, even if you fail you're still gaining XP, you have to do exercises to stay fit and become stronger. to kill time you(grinding) do some pushups, lifting, leg exercises, etc. Jump higher, run faster, stronger punches & kicks, better agility, etc. The game starts off where the character is on a heist and gets arrested and thrown in prison, on his way to death row there is a prison break and he has to escape, when he was in prison he worked out all the time so he is used to it, so the grindin/leveling up aspect comes into play

Real time platformer choose your path and let it play out like Frozen Synapse

2D shooter platform where the ammo is tetriminos and the enemies corresond accordingly

2D platformer, there's alot of negativity in the world, the character runs through it as fast as they can and when their run is done they can look at the world map and determine what needs to be fixed, they can plan out a route and then go back through the world and try to complete it, the trick is they always have to be moving forward so you try and choose the path that will cause the most amount of good

2D platformer coop where the characters are robots? But they are attached by a rope/chain and they have to solve puzzles, momentum comes into play, rope/chain has different states?

A game that involves parasites and makes it fun to take over a host maybe involve hacking? Parasite Paradise? The game starts off with one "bug" has a certain ablility and in each world there is a new "boss" that the "bug" can absorb giving it new abilities. Have land, air, sea, and different powers from each bug. 2D platformer fast paced, alien/futuristic/neon looking the bugs are circular kind of like a wheel, they almost look mechanical or robotic

2D platformer that has the character start off with all the abilities but after each stage or world they lose one ability, the game adjusts to this somehow therefore making the game more difficult, what would be the incentive to progress though? The effects that the boss or world have on the character take a power away and maybe a bonus would be after you beat the game you can revisit each stage/world with all powers or "turn on" certain ones

Mix a Space Invaders type game with Breakout, the enemies shoot at you and you have to defend with your "paddle"

Super Stickman Golf + Frozen Synapse + Worms but with ninjas, instead of golf holes there's a base to infiltrate and different enemies to take out along the way, have the player choose different power is before starting the mission

Have two stick figures throwing a ball back and forth, they can move around and jump. Maybe work in platforming, multi-player support. Button sensitive throwing determines how far the ball goes. Work in different sports mechanics, like alley-oop the ball to another player and have them dunk it. Throw in tricks. Take it further and add something like dodgeball death match or a water balloon fight where there's splashes everywhere. Add in baseball bat mechanics, the player can run and scoop up the ball on the fly and catch the ball in midair and then throw it. If the sports mechanics are thrown in have a modifier button where the player dons a sports uniform e.g. throw on basketball shorts and jersey and head band and gives them the ability to dribble, shoot, and dunk the ball. Have different objects in the game that alter the ball and player physics e.g. trampolines, speed up strips, portals. I can see this being a really fun silly game that's easy to pickup and learn and play. Use scalable vector graphics and cartoon like graphics. Have different colors scheme and character customization. 2D

2D platformer where there's a timer and the world is slowly changing, when the time runs out the player can morph if they want to to adapt to the level? Needs work

2D platformer with a character who has a skateboard its his weapon, He can ride it, kick it at enemies, grind things, hippie jumps, use it to make tough jumps, wall plants to traverse vertical sections, wall rides for long gaps, boneless, have certain objects be only interactable by certain moves, a kick flip will have to spin through an object, do a tail slide to flip a switch on the side, make it a random encounter each game and give options for crazy moves

2D/3D platformer where you're a wrestler main emphasis is fast paced always on the move, grapple wrestling moves and high flying, give it a comic type crazy vibe, moving power bomb, choke slams, body slams, spears, suplexes, flying elbow and leg drop, throw in ladders, tables and other weapons, hurricarnas, very arcady

Have a 2D action platformer where the screen is locked in place horizontally but they can move upwards. After they reach the next screen they have the option to upgrade their character and weapons, the gimmick is though if they fall back down a level then they lose those upgrades. Maybe have a mode where the enemies remain tougher even if the player falls down?

Editable/Edible a game where you're a creature who can build/create stuff which is where the editable comes into play, and then the creature can eat their creations for points or ammo or something like that, hence the edible. 

A game that's full of ironies, ex. interacting with a stress ball causes more stress for the character in the game. etc.

Create a platformer where it's  horizontal , complete it one way then go back through it and make it vertical or upside down, interesting experiment if anything

Top down rpg with random encounters that are shmups

So basically a tube winding all the way from top to bottom of Page in all different directions. The tube is divided into different sets of colors. As the ball races down the tube different buttons correspond to the colors and when the buttons are hit correctly the player gets a speed boost.

Have a game where it's an entire HTML5 Web Page and the user interacts with it, so the Page literally scrolls up and down and the character navigates the map

2D game, the player slows down time but when the world resumes to normal the character becomes slow and there's this trade off and strategy
