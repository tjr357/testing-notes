# Stand up 10/22/21


Durga to work on the Polish and French translations cards

Ashritha will be able to complete the translation file today

\- Enhancement that we'll bring in and needs refinement

\------------------------------

Work is divided up by customer
Destination email = who the email recipient
Web email = who sent the email to open the Case

As GI Olive
I want to easily identify who sent in the email that created the Case
so that I can choose who to help first
