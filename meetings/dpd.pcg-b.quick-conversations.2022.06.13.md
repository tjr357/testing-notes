@people.MattWalter

- Called after attending our stand-up today
- Make sure the tech leads, BA's are looking ahead and planning
  - Work with them
- The UX team is going to be working on Discovery, design, wireframes, user research and their outputs will be used in later sprints
- We need to manage backlog so we're not waiting on dependencies
- In stand-ups if I need to follow-up with someone, table the conversation and meet with them ASAP
- Bring the level of accountablity, follow-up with folks
  - They will see that I'm asking them about something and they should be getting it done
- Team Ownership
  - The team needs to be believe in the Sprint Goal(s), help them buy into them
- Make sure people understand their roles
- Leverage the agile coach
- Be adaptable
  - Roles, teams, capabilities will be changing
