- Make sure we follow the exit criteria
- Helps us understand if we're overloaded
- Do we need more help when it comes to testing
- Make this more part of our process rather than just a "it happens in stand-up"

- Using Defect category/type, fields, resolution, root cause, 
- Things were missing
- Can we make this required?
    - Unfortunately we cannot 
- Misrepresents our metrics, we cannot find trends



- Enhancments are defined as "Under 120 hours"
- Right now the B+S enhancement has been placed into 1 epic
    - Could we create Features rather than 1 enhancement Feature, this would go under an Epic  
- Asked to keep track of %'s, parent of enhancement feature is being used



- Legacy app support
    - PPM number was needed


- Prodly B+S could be a lean initiative

- Provar
    - We can adopt it and be the future champions of it 
    - What baby steps can we take
    - Requirement: Get this up and running on scratch orgs
