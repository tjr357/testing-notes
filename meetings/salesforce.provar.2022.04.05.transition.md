### People
- Chris J.
- Adam W.
- Nick L.

### Notes
- Nick did discuss with Chris, we are about 30% in with regression
  - There is opp to refactor the old tests before tackling the big backlog
  - When should we have the BA's and Dev's get involved, Chris will be the guy
    - Have the Train the trainer mindset, we need that so there's a sense of ownership
    - We need to have people learn so they can be the people to help out, the first line of defense
  - Nick does like the guidelines and best practices, this will help us stabilize
  - What is the target for the developers


### Goals
- We want developers to write Provar tests as part of their development process
  - Follow best practices and guidelines
  - Be comfortable
  - Be able to teach others
  - They will be given X number of tests to create, but if they achieve the aforementioned goals before X are completed then they've graduated
  - Developers give a testimony on their Provar experience(s)
    - The program needs to hear from someone who is NOT QA :)

- Business Analysts to create the Test Plan?
  - Take existing tests and put them into a Test Plan
  - They will execute test too
  - I suggest, BA's pair with developers and/or QA folk to create Tests and Test Plans

- Make sure expectations are clear
  - What is the order of operations, want to minimize any confusion

### Next Steps
- Sarat and Tao
  - Finish Provar tests on their cards
  - Provide a testimonial
- Have retro to get feedback
  - Nick, Chris, Sarat, Tao
- Definine success criteria of when we can expand to other people/teams
- Documentation
  - Get to a solid foundation with the understanding that it will be evolving. Include:
    - When to write a test
    - Best practices
      - Framework
    - Tips & Tricks
    - Program expectations
- Identify user stories within Feature(s) that could be candidates to have automation
  - Does this get created as a program norm?
