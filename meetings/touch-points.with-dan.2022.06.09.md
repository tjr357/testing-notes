### Previous

[[June 1 Touch Point|touch-points.with-dan.2022.06.01]]

### Notes

- Cadence based events, with limited availability
- Schedule time with Sam for ever 2 weeks
  - Communicate that we need her there, can she make it, maybe stand-up?
- Work to find a compromise
  - Find something that works for both the Team and the Business
- What stand-ups can Sam be at?
- Be coach for the team, I've recognized the gaps so think of improvements
- I don't need to have all the answers but let them know I will support them

#### Working remote

- Ask the team to include me on every meeting as OPTIONAL, so I can stay plugged in, I might not even speak, just listen
- Ask the team to keep the board up to date, ask the team to use the private channels
- Open each day, ice breaker, get norms for team chats, maybe saying good bye to folks, keep that team spirit up
- Create a social/happy hour, try not to talk about work, informal team building

### Questions

- BA is confused about what to do?

### Action Items

- ??? Start introducing Fan 4's, office hours, every day or every other day, longer half-day sprint planning
- [x] COP, how to join a new team remotely
- Have a backlog of items of improvements to share with the coaches that are coming!
