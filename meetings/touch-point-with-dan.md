### Notes
- How often do we want to meet?

- Learn who the core team, roster is
- Support roles and shared support roles
- Connect with Bill, to see the similarities between the teams
- Do the pods have names?
- Focus on the Scrum framework and scrum guide
- Focus on the basics and don't get fancy
- I will be looked at as a leader, try to **stay out of the content discussions**
  - Facilitate, guide vs. direct, coach
    - Speak of prior examples, **remind them of prior agreements**, 
    - Nudge and keep people on the same track towards the same goal
- Don't get stuck in the middle, have Tamara meet with someone else who might be giving directions
- Ask the questions
  - ex. "does this really provide value"
- Keep organized, stay focused, believe in myself, keep things written down, stick with it, vent to Dan
- Being an SM can be a little more vague
- Think about patterns that have made other teams successful and learn to avoid the ones that didn't work
  - Don't try to emulate folks, but think about their patterns
- Stick to basics and don't try to overwhelm the team or myself


- Inform Tamara of what happened this week before checking out tomorrow
- Sync back with Tamara and Dan when getting back from vacation


Break into new note
- Start looking at things I would like to see changed
- Take notes, review them at the end of the week, affinity mapping
- Stay organized and the team organized
- Build backlog and prioritize, make my own sprint goal
- Weekly assessment with Dan, Dan to share
- Has the team done any retros yet?????
  - Discuss safe space, the team is going to benefit from this and this, I will inform you of the team's outcomes, enable the team and take direction, be encouraged to self-organize
  - Make sure Chirayu sees me as an ally, over communicate, share topics that I've thought of
