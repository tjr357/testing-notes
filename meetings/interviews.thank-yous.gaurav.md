Hi Gaurav,

It was really great meeting you this afternoon, thank you for answering all of my questions! It's exciting to see your vision for the program and the company and I would love to be a part of it, I think we could do some amazing things!
Thank you for sharing your story and the advice that you did. I think in any role but especially a Scrum Master, listening is a critical competency.

If you need further clarification on anything or have any questions for me, please reach out.

Hope to talk with you soon! :)

Thank you,
Taylor

P.S. As you showed interest in the board game I'm designing here's some info on it.
In *Brew Me Up*, players will semi-cooperatively work together to deliver beers to aliens before they blow up the Earth! Players will have 3 years to collect ingredients & recipes, brew beer, build machines and deliver beer to a revolving alien ship. There can only be a winner if the aliens get their beer but if they do not by the end of year 3, they will blow up the planet and everyone loses.
