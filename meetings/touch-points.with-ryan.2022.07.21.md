We should be discussing, how to break them down
When stroies have been hanging out, let's break it up 
So with the React learning, how can we set them up for success
Help them show their progress

If we run into tech difficulties, we want to show we're not stuck and show that progress

We've identified all these pieces but we didn't go back and reassess
Was there a blocker that hasn't been identified

Need to figure out the root causes for things

Help the team dynamics 

What else do you need to help? 
Get him to walk through the difficulties that are there
Hopefully he's comfortable talking with me

Positive intent
