### Questions
- What will the project be like?
- How many testers per team?
    - 1 per team
    - 2 openings

### Notes
- Brand new team, spinning up Pods, product specific
- There are some challenges, looking for new and fresh ideas, testing and development, things are up in the air
- Large focus on getting automation off the ground
- Applications will be custom, figure out what's the best tool for the job
    - There is a team that's doing ReactJS
- How can we help enable others    
- One team is working on the MVP

- 1 more interview with Guarav, maybe Dennis and some team leads

- Dennis will be at the Director level, at the Integrated Order Management
- PCG Blending is the other project that's been running for a while
    - Work Permit app
    - They are in desperate need from the testing side of things
    - So they are so early in the project, they would have wanted to have a QA tester right from the get go
