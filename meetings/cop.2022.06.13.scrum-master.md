### Topics

#### Sprint goals? What's the deal with them?

- Artifacts coming out of Sprint Planning
  - Backlog
  - Sprint goal
    - Make sure you're getting agreement so there's accountability
      - There needs to be buy-in otherwise there is no weight to it
    - They can tell you some things about your team when you're not making the goal
    - Does the team understand they're responsible for completing the goal
      - People tend to let the goals carry over
      - Sometimes the priority changes
- Sprint goal is not reviewed throughout the Sprint, until the next Sprint planning
- We need to be spearheading the conversation towards the goals

#### Team building and supporting team culture while being remote

- Water cooler conversations are not happening
- Need to be intentional and carve out the time for this
- Keep a social hour, whether it's lunch or HH, just don't talk about work

### Action Items

- Jenny will take the next one and host
