### People
- @ScottStorm
- @MarianneBrooks

### Agenda
- Want to nail down the naming of the Tests

### Notes
- Every work/shop order should be unique
- 3 Tests for the MVP
  - Delta E, is the unit
  - Change to Color Delta E
  - Gloss
    - 20, 60 and 85
    - Choose 60 gloss 
- Methods should be auto-populated and static
  - Reference to a doc that shows them how to run the Test
- Unit should also be auto-populated and static
- Methods and Units will be stored in Admin section
- Does Admin functionality get included with the MVP? 
  - Marianne doesn't think so
- Methods could be located in different data spots
  - MES, Oracle and/or Product Vision
