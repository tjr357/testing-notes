Agile transformation is a temporary pillar

Stay in tact, do a lift & shift 

- Consistent and shared consensus, gives the *perceived* loss of autonomy
- Sharing API's and libraries
  - Losing automnomy to do things the wrong way, should be fixed
- Automonmy should be at the "hands-on keyboard" level, not at Tamara's level
- The more Sr. leaders should be hand-cuffed, lower level folks should be empowered
- We do NOT have a "go-North" strategy, we cannot agree as a company, people become too far into the details!!! You don't know what the person next to you knows
