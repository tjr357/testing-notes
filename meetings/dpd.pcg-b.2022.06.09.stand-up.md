We should be able to demo in Dev at the very least

- [x] POW-210, 211 convert to subtasks and link to UI development part 2 card
- [x] Delete PCGQC-12, PCGQC-35

- [ ] What is our Definiton of Done?!?!?!

- [ ] Update board based on conversation
  - Keep On-Hold,
  - Columns show what we need to talk about
  - Testing and Ready to Deploy are subtasks for "In-Progress"
  - In Review is needed
  - This is for the team's benefit
