Working agreements

Help support me on goal and strategy

Dan's style:
Stay tightly coupled on goals and strategy
stay loose on execution

Keep Dan informed, where he's needed and what I need to be the most successful, 
risks and issues I'm facing to support and accurately speak for me on my behalf

Keep feedback as a two way street

Taking time off, very flexible, just ask for as much notice as possible, so there's alignment and coverage, Kronos and communicate to team

Keep WFH schedule up-to-date

Take advantage of summer hours, plan ahead

Mid-year review, Dan will talk with Tamara about this, might need to get some feedback on this, next day or two

- [>] Waterfall moment is a coaching opportunity
Having a PO would help show and recognize the incremental progress

- [<] Think more about the root cause, share with Chirayu and Ryan, form coaching perspective
Resistance to change, this is the challenge, WIIFM is real

Keep being a good listener, understand thoughts and the situation, how to connect with them, meet them where they are, speak in terms where they are

Needs of the team need to be first and foremost, but there are other stakeholders, people who are sponsoring the work, forecast and communicate, speak with and align with value

Where am I finding resistance, communicate and connect with those people

Continue building relationships

Don't think about it as a conflict, but rather a conversation

I hear what you're saying, repeat in their own words
Maybe these planning sessions are distracting you from doing the things you love like coding
Here is the goal of these meetings, we're still learning, the meetings will get more efficient
Don't ignore the current state
Paint the vision and show the future
We'll be recognized for our efforts and blazing the trail
Working towards the future
Learn from the past, look forwards!

- [<] Come up with a game plan, have a mock convo with Dan

- [<] ! User Story Mapping of the Remote exercise


Quick list of meetings in a given sprint, goals, objs., time it's taking, how can we get those objectives done without meeting for everyting? Quantify and align on this, could be a draft file vs. a meeting, can the team do more preparation for backlog, come prepared with meetings

Re-state and share the norms, inform team of meetings throughout 

set aside time for Planning 30 min every day, will help with stress

Pull in Dan when needed

Cadence Half and hour every other week
