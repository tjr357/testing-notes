- Teams and Scrum Masters

## Patterns that have worked
- Keeping things fun
- Established team norms
- Paired programming
- Test driven development (TDD)


## Patterns to avoid
- Dictating meetings
- Not willing to try new things, failing fast
- Not having a dedicated tester
- Skipping retros
- 

- THINK Think about my own experience, reflect on and what's common of teams that were successful, issues, roadblocks, impediments, people. What do I like about certain teams, think about what to bring into new team. This will help connect the most with others
