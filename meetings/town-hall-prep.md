- Create the polls and the antidotes, how to take the data and use it 

- Content
    - Dave's brother could do an overview of security being in the FBI

- What is your favorite book of all time?
    - 
- What book are you currently reading or would like to read?
- What world from a book would you like to visit or live in?

As today is Dr. Seuss's birthday and "National Read Across America" day
There's nothing like reading a good book in my opinion. Thomas Jefferson (3rd POTUS) is said to have between 6k - 10k books in his lifetime and once wrote "I cannot live without books". Out of all of those books 

Hopefully you have a favorite book, whether you read it or listened to it. And if not there's definitely one there for you. Whether it's to gain knowledge, wisdom or just get lost in hopefully you can fall into one soon.
