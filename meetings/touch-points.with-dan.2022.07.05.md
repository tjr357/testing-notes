### Previous

[[June 28 Touch Point|touch-points.with-dan.2022.06.28]]

### Notes

- Think about when to use the "Risk" log, have people update it, encourage them to document the risks, get the right people to talk about them
- Get a more predictable Sprint velocity
- Focus on the backlog, prioritize and score
- Focus on delivery in Sprints, capture metrics at end of Sprint
- Should be able to pull up Jira at any given time to show someone "when it will be done" here's what we're trending and forecasting, getting people to trust the tools more
- The development team are not the only perspective to consider when it comes to forecasting
- Trust the Scrum framework
- Remind the team there are stakeholders
- Forecasts are not predictions
- Hylaine is to be a strategic partners, foster the relationship, rely on eachother, working agreement
- Provide specific issues and discuss with Ryan
