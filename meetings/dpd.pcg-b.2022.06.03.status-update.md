- User stories are too technical
- Wants them to use Personas, journeys
- Focus on the bigger value
- This all needs to be baked in
- Will be pushing for the Facility experience
- Need to drive into the logic and security model
  - What data they are able to see
- The UI development is integrated with the stories and comments are added from GitHub
- We don't have a "Quality" step
  - We are missing the Quality aspect
- Unit testing
  - At the atomic level, functions
- Integration testing
- Test engineer is needed, we want as much automation
- Dedicated tester across the teams!!!
  - QA lead needed too, testing approach, strategy
  - IMPORTANT Come up with the strategy
- We need these teams fully staffed
- I shared with Matt that we don't have a dedicated Product Owner
  - He's meeting with Laura K. to discuss some of these things
  - Need a dedicated PO
    - Need to be writing the functional user stories
  - Maybe a dedicated Product Manager
- We need to be working ahead of the team, having the backlog grooming sessions
- We are getting an agile coach at the end of June
  - We can bounce ideas off of them
- Let's start with the WHY! 
  - "We think if we build this"
  - IMPORTANT Create hypotheses and radiate this
  - How do we work towards proving, validating these?
    - How do we measure these things
- Move towards a Product team!!!! 
- When people are passionate their work shows it
