3 different Delta E's

- What is the target date for MVP?
  - Date for increment 2

- Record all 3 glosses but only 1 is printed

- Frog hopper example for gloss
- 3 test types
  - range, pass/fail, derived range off of target
- Strictly within Workbench, no Aurora

- Save vs. complete
  - Only a label should be printed when it's "Complete"
  - Print things that won't change, print only saved things
  - Save as you go, so you can print as you go
- Let's get the labels out there to our facilities get some feedback

- Figure out how it's used and build it based off of that

- Uvilten has helped the Zebra label and Suresh will need to knowledge share with him

- IDEA Invite Sam to stand-up when we create a new Story!!!!
  - Put these new stories into the Thoughtboard

### Questions for Marianne from Sam

@people.MarianneBrooks

1. What tests are preloaded?
2. Are they always the same tests on label? Standardized?
   1. If they are standardized there's no need for the panel checkboxes
3. Will they need to attach orders like they do now in POS?
