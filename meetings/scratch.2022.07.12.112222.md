Nice improvements, listening to the customer, adding in the features.
Format and features have been really good 
- [ ] Townhall, Dan will want some screenshots to show the App, Townhall is next week
  - [ ] Screenshots to show Shop Floor notes and Scheduling, 
- Logging in and out, has this been addressed? 
  - Suresh said we'll be able to get this fixed for the initial launch for MVP
- Looks great, very much appreciate everyone's hardwork 

Chirayu shared that we might have to delay the launch by 2 weeks, Dan is okay with this


Matt's Comments
"Are there work orders that are on hold that the Facility would want to be aware of how long they have been on-hold? How do these Holds impact OTIF?" - Matt Walter
    - "Could we color code or prioritize and filter to bring the on-hold orders to the top?"
    - These are metrics we can track and get metrics to see if we're improving OTIF or not
  - Get Dan involved in the planning phases
