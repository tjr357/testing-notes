A lot of unknowns as we migrate to QA to Prod
- This slowed down everything
- We can get to Dev much faster

- Confusion of business, they were out of sync
  - There was frustration to see this
  - We will have conflicting business requirement
  - PO to sit down with business folks ahead of meeting rather than have a discussion and negotiation in that meeting
  - Lack of relationship and investment in that 
  - Feedback structure up? with PO and Business, with lack of time with PO, we need to get their buy-in


- Reach out to Mel and help him with figuring out when to reach out to Earl
  - Switch Mel's focus to React
- Maybe even turn the camera on for the first 3 minutes

- Developers can see meetings as a waste of time, it's time not getting development done
  - Stagger meetings
- Stand-ups are vauable
- Backlog grooming not seem super important
- Getting things done, and not being able to focus is frustrating
- Sprint planning not super valuable
- "I want to know why I'm doing this card"
- "Give me the requirements." 

Backlog Grooming and Sprint Planning - Suresh
Stand-ups and Retros - everyone

Demos - optional because they're recorded

Mel needs to eat lunch, give him the opportunity
