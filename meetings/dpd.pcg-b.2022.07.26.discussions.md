The way we're working looks like waterfall

We don't have to have an ENTIRE screen completed before we deliver something

Don't get hung up on the terminology

Rethinking how we're going to deliver it 

How long will it take to deliver an epic, discuss it, break it into stories (deliverable), not the whole functionality, pieces to the puzzle, when completed is the FULL deliverable

Why spend the time making the tasks, rather than just do them

Allentown/Macungie is our biggest facility, why did we ship to them first?!?!?!?!?!?!

Dan, Marianne and Kyle need to stop being the voice of the customer

Working and working as well as it could are different things

UX and agile timelines are not in-alignment
