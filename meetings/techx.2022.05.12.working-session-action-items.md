### 8 - 10 Reasons to "Start", "Stop" and "Continue"
#### Start  
- Dusting with Swiffer wand
  - It's so much easier, faster and no harmful chemicals
- Cleaning windows with newspapers
  - It will leave the windows streak free
#### Stop
- Making the bed only on weekends
  - "How can you change the world if you can't even keep your room clean."
- Cleaning bathrooms with harmful chemicals
  - We're breathing in these chemicals and their residue can be ingested by the kids and dogs
- Running Roomba at 10am
  - This is when I have meetings and is very disruptive, let's move it towards the end of the work day
- Pulling weeds on Saturday afternoon
  - It's soooo freaking hot out!! Do it when it's cooler out
- Washing dishes with same sponge
  - Throw the sponge out after 4 weeks, bacteria builds up on it
#### Continue

  - The lawn is looking great!

- Putting toys away after each play session
