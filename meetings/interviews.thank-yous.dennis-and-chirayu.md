Hi Dennis and Chirayu,

Thank you for your time yesterday in interviewing me for the Sr. QA Engineering role and answering all of my questions. I feel more informed about this role and I believe with my experience, we could take quality to the next level in your program.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any more clarification on our discussion.

Additionally, I thought some more about what I've learned in the last 4ish years:
- Crucial conversations
  - I was successfully able to use this tool to discuss an issue with a colleague. We came out of the discussion with a clear understanding and expectations of each other. Thankfully it also led to a friendship.
- Working with vendors
  - Through aquiring Provar I had to learn how to work through our 3PM process, the contract team and how to communicate with another company
- Design thinking
  - I facilitated a group in last year's Think-a-thon using design thinking practices
- Mob testing
  - Led several mob testing sessions, several people work together to test in a timeboxed session with different roles that are rotated

Hope to talk with you both soon. :)

Thank you,
Taylor
