## Miscellaneous
- @Chip:
    - Will meeting with Ashley, proposing that the Owner of the card
        - Owner - should always remain as the Developer
        - Pair 1 - Whoever is working on the card at the time
            - This would change throughout the life of the card 
        - Pair 2 - PO or Proxy PO or even possibly the Story Acceptor
    - It could be bc when there's an issue on the card in Adam's report it's hard to figure out who the PO is
