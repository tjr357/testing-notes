### People

### Notes

Relationships started on the business side, with the facilities, engagement starts there
Currently this is not happening
Get what we can get
Consider user analytics, tag Workbench and IOM
PenDo, WalkMe
This route is less intrustive
They can provide feedback right into the tool
Scott could be doing the analytics too
We're probably not going to get the direct engagement from them right now

- Busy, perceived value
- Possible resistance to using the new tool

Need to get our business people more engaged
PO and a Product Manager (strategy, working with end users, research, data analytics, work with UX) will be hired

Need to measure the value, are they actually getting value
Allowing for efficencies? Metrics

O&KRs

Take feedback, match against data and business

Business, UX, IT
Viability, Usability, Feasability
Scoring metrics to weigh the outcomes we're trying to get to
What are the main things we're focusing on, it should have a positive impact
Success should be measured by Results
Direct Impact needs to be measured
Impact should be leading to our prioritization

Assuming up front, but get real data to help us prioritize

"Inspired" book Marty Cagan can be expensed, book club, talk with Matt every week,

Same API to serve up different experiences

CSRs and Ops Manager are who we should be targeting now, most likely

We need to have empathy for our business stakeholders, they have other full-time jobs as well
Business is ramping up their digital literacy
Have some pre-work for the business before coming to meetings, share the outcome and be prepared

Be proactive in understanding the health of the app
Be confident in every release, 100% Prod-like environments

The next 12 months, we need to deliver a lot

Monitors and things in place to be alerted of issues in Prod

Not acceptable to ship broken things, strive for greatness

- [ ] Create a list of gaps and share with Matt

### Scott's notes

- Matrix weighted according to the main problems/outcomes we are trying to achieve
- measure the success
- business viability, UX usability and IT feasibility.
- our success should not be measured because we release something- we need to measure on results.
- we release has direct impacts that are measurable according to the outcomes.
- Solving High Value / High Impact problems.
- Inspired.
- give them homework so they come prepared for meetings and participate.
- What can I do to help overcome? solve problems proactively BEFORE they go to prod and understanding the health of the application
- as confidant as we can before we go to prod. if not what

GAPS-WRITE UP FOR MATT:

- environments configured like production
- monitors setup in prod to we don't want facilities tell us about issues in prod we want to know them in advance, and testing gaps.
- so we can service and keep the business functioning.
- things breaking and blowing up in prod is not acceptable.
- release to smaller facilities first and let it bake in for a couple of days before we release.
- 0 disruptions and 0 downtime.
