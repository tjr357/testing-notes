### Notes

- Chirayu said we are going live on Monday, this is dependent on the Security scan
- Kyle is taking a vacation on Friday, so need to let him know about the our launch so he can get the GTI report
- ![PCG Workbench Increment 2](/assets/images/2022-07-20-10-05-46.png)

- By introducing notes, waste management will be reduced, this reduces time walking around in the facility

Kyle
> how are we communicating these Increment 2 changes to the sites?

Scott
> Send out email everyday to the sites, leading up to the launch and keep asking them to review the site

Kyle
> Is the data on workbench accessible to be reported on? This is more of a management tool

Dan
> Could we assign a value to the white and clear to say we've never made this before
