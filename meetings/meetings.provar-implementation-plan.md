- Recreating tests 
    - We are just going through the old tests and recreating the necessary ones as well as making improvements during the recreation
- Nightly Runs
    - Just need to work with Srini and Ryan to get the 2 github actions set up and automated

- Dashboards 
    - Probably work with Srini and maybe Chris Crowder to get the database set up and connect the nightly runs to it and then we can start making reports in grafana
- Developers writing tests
    - We need to discuss the plan for this, come up with how to pilot it with Service. Define what is worth creating a test for, etc etc. And if there is still time left in the PI and we have completed the callable tests then we might be able to start the pilot in PI, otherwise it will be next PI
- Take into account, In-PI automation and backlog
- SAND bandwidth, to open up in mid-March
    - to do In-PI automation for CPQ (Automotive?)
- Susan wants in-PI automation to happen for at least 1 project
    - Leads 2.0
    - GI LWR
    - Automotive CPQ
- We need to manage ourselves to get the in-PI automation completed
