### Notes
- US one going live April 15
- CA is gaoing August 1
- Doing translations on the site, to Spanish
- CA is translating to French
- Need to figure out if the website will send a language specific acknowledgement or a bi-lingual (eng on top, spanish on bottom or vv)
- The translations are already completed, we're just not using them
- May need to meet with Kara Z., the business, or the website owner
- @Chip will get a meeting scheduled
  - @AubreyL will send an email instead
- If the Contact Us page is in English, do we want a box that says something like "Reply to me in this language ____ "
- Love Your Color guarantee is gone?
- Could we just turn off the acknowledgements?
  - Might have to because of the legalities
