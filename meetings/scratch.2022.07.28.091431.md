We have a number of self-service Jira Training resources that are available from the Rally to Jira migration project efforts on the home page under the same title, here:  <https://swcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/RallyCAAgileCentral/SitePages/Home.aspx#jira-training>  Honestly, given that the team has been working in the tool for a bit already, other than the Pluralsight training which requires requesting a license, I'm not sure if that's what the team needs.

Because we were tracking toward a deadline for migrating users as opposed to new teams, we have not established any standards as of yet.  That is expected to be a separate project; however, I'm not sure of the timing.

All of that said, we do have the Agile playbook available as a reference resource, Devi has done training for other groups new to Jira and Ryan Fish had mentioned he could assist with Jira.  So, in the meantime, perhaps we can start with the specific questions/challenges the team is facing to be sure we are addressing those first.  It'd be helpful if you sent me a list so I can loop in Tamara and Devi to align on next steps.
