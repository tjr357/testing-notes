- Hieu leading it

- Wants to include a status indicator either of the workbench or an individual order
- Additionally functionality can be added in the 3 dots menu, would stack vertically
- Test would be a drop down with type ahead on Tests
- Sam owes us the Tests
- Removing the Tests will probably happen later
- Product Details not needed until COA comes into the picture
- Trying to keep the primary buttons within view
- Batches last 1-2 hours long
