Support Request creation will notify rep through email and mobile
When support Request is closed rep will be notified through email and mobile

Our focus is on Support Request creation and resolution
We believe it delivers value to our Sales Reps through affirmation their Support Request was submitted and resolved, this gives them the assurance that their customers are being taken care of 
This will be confirmed when they can receive email and mobile notifications when a Support Request is created and when they are resolved

Our focus is on getting at least 1 user story automated with Provar
We believe it delivers value as part of our automation initiative
This will be confirmed when Sarat and Tao can automate their user stories (S67499, S67497) using Provar in a lower environment
