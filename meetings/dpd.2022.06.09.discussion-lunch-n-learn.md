- We can't teach people to be good presenters 
- But we can give them the tools to present better
- Some people are not great speakers and presenters and they may never
  - What's in PowerPoint
  - What's in Teams
  - How can things be designed
  - Can we standarize our presentations
  - Skillsets
- Meeting options no need for Teams live, the same types of things can be achieved
- People can record themselves and the slides through PPT
- Give people the option to present for others
  - Not everyone can present
  - Strength based leadership, nobody likes to be uncomfortable 
- Use the notes in PPT
- Does PluralSight have any classes
- Show people what they can do themselves, keep it simple 
- THINK Do we have Presentation coaches? 
  - UX involvement
