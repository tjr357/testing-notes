### Agenda
> Within this meeting, we will:  
- Review identified open items and action items for Taylor's Transition.  
- Understand what our desired outcomes are and what activities we need to perform to get us there.

### From Dave
Transition Take Always:

- Focus on strategic planning vs trying to get tactical items completed.  What knowledge, perspective and ideas will we be losing that can be relayed, leveraged or documented.
- Provar - 1st Priority\
    - Collaboration with Chris Johnson to identify a roadmap of activities and roadmap
        - More detailed at the start gradually getting more higher level at the end
        - Priority on the tasks to get everyone engaged and using first, ensuring that regression suite gaps are filled in a later phase, gives us the ability to leverage everyone.
- Skilling Pilot
    - No specific action items at this time other than informing participants of your new opportunity.
- Service Team QA Training
    - Focus on providing refresher, tips, tricks and best practices to Sarat and Tao; Chip and Igor to participate for awareness.
        - Potential ppt, check list or documentation to help leverage in the future
        - Stress documentation for the testing that was performed.
  - Ok for Sarat and Tao to start to test each others cards this sprint.  At least gives us a chance to see how it will go.
        - Exception would be for our current Project Feature:
F6332: CBG EMEA Sales Reps can submit Cases to the Customer Service Team -- Lets try to get this one done this week!

- Completing the Testing Backlog
    - Potential to go through and remove or identify any unneeded tests.  That way we do not have to research in the future.
    - Is there potential to have Sarat and Tao make these tests in Provar, gets them experience and also provides faster progress?
