### People
- @Chip, @DanRaczka, @MartinaJ, @JennyC

### Topic
- "How do your teams facilitate User Story Mapping?"
    - SAND Team is not really doing them, they don't really see the need to do one

### Notes
- A lot of the teams BA's are just going to the Discovery
- Dev Lead is involved in the Discovery process, to think like a tech perspective
    - Dev Lead's are pulled away from their ongoing work
    
- Take a first pass, and see if someone can tell the story
- Review every sprint
