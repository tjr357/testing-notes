Marianne asked about the QC demo, we said today is just the workbench, QC will be later is what we told her

Dan's Comments
Nice improvements, listening to the customer, adding in the features.
Format and features have been really good 
- [x] Townhall, Dan will want some screenshots to show the App, Townhall is next week
  - [x] Screenshots to show Shop Floor notes and Scheduling, 
- Logging in and out, has this been addressed? 
  - Suresh said we'll be able to get this fixed for the initial launch for MVP
- Looks great, very much appreciate everyone's hardwork 

Chirayu shared that we might have to delay the launch by 2 weeks, Dan is okay with this


Matt's Comments
"Are there work orders that are on hold that the Facility would want to be aware of how long they have been on-hold? How do these Holds impact OTIF?" - Matt Walter
    - "Could we color code or prioritize and filter to bring the on-hold orders to the top?"
    - These are metrics we can track and get metrics to see if we're improving OTIF or not
  - Get Dan involved in the planning phases
