### Notes
- Skilling office hours are going to be monthly now
- Skilling Celebration
  - April 12, Tuesday
- Update was given to Ivy and HR leadership last week
- Ivy spoke with the Skilling Participants on 3/8
### Gamification & Skill IQs
- There are anxieties with the Skill IQs because they are timed
  - This is ok, these are not going away
- If they're not ready to take the Skill IQ, that's okay, they can come back to later if it's applicable to them
- There needs to be a plan and expectations when it comes to the Skill IQs
  - They shouldn't be taken a whole bunch of Skill IQs one after another
  - Figure out what level they want to be at and it's ok to know some of the skill, no one says they have to be an expert in them
  - Self-teaching is difficult, we want things to be fun for them
    - More details to come on this
### Skilling Inventory + Adjustments
- The current inventory of Pluralsight courses for all 9 roles has been shared to the files of the General Teams channel
- 300 PS courses were retired recently
  - 30 day notice of when courses will be retired, they are offered a replacement
- Pluralsight access will be extended in Q2, they can request access, there just needs to be the licenses available
  - 9 - 10 Pathways, anyone can take these
  - There will be a self-service plan
### Timing of Openings/Role Placement
- Role Sponsors are responsible for identifying openings for permanent placement, work with Assignment Managers
  - This will be coming sooner rather than later

### Feedback
- Change Readiness Survey and Stakeholder Interviews
- What lessons were learned as we go into Q2
- What concerns/impacts do we feel need to be addressed before scaling
### Miscellaneous
- There are external courses that can be added to a Pathway, just send a list and share with Linda
