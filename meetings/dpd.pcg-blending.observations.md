Our Team Norms discussion had to be pushed back to next week and I wanted to discuss our cadence and restructuring our sprint, we definitely need to make our Sprints more structured.

We will have a toooon of carry over into the next Sprint, which is what I was worried about, however there doesn't seem to be any consequences right now

Sam our PO has been super busy and has not made many of our meetings, so I'm going to discuss with our BA about this and see how much of an issue he thinks it is
- Build relationship with PO, interest in their interests and my interests
  - Keep positive, "Here are the good things that will happen when you attend"
  - Try to be an ally
- Sync with Chirayu
- Keep notes in *private* for when the PO has been there, etc. monitor trends

For carry over, this is common, which my teams still struggle with


I would advise you to keep track of your sprint plans, and note what was carried over each sprint. At least you capture the baseline data and can track trends over time


Like, how many cards were planned into the sprint, how many were added/removed, done/carried over


Since this is your first sprint, I would focus on continuing to make observations, keep them organized in notes (like you did above), to help document the baseline time health (such as with carry over)


Don’t stress too much about having to fix everything now. Take an assessment of the current state, and then plan small iterative  improvements
