### Article

[[Products and Platforms Is Your Tech Operating Model Ready|articles.products-and-platforms-is-your-tech-operating-model-ready]]

The article discusses these 3 points:
> Companies can ease the transition by taking three actions:

> 1. organizing technology teams around user-facing products and the underlying platforms that enable them
> 2. creating a governance structure to keep the technology organization focused on the business’s strategic priorities
> 3. establishing a rigorous system for prioritizing and delivering technology work.

> Platforms are the back-end technology capabilities, whether provided by individual systems or by assemblies of multiple systems, that power products, as well as the enterprise more broadly.

- [ ] This makes sense, need to figure out all of these teams, Chirayu did share them, but it's worth a deeper dive

> Typical platforms found at large companies include those for enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, inventory management, and field operations.

- ??? What are these teams for us?
- [ ] Discuss with @people.ChirayuPoundarik
- I almost want a visual chart to point at and use and say alright what you said sounds like it's dependent on this, so we need to talk with this team, specifically this person. The sooner we can do this, the better we can plan. It would be nice to have pictures of people and representations of each team. Basically sticker each card with their dependencies
- ??? Cross-functional, how am I helping the team and enabling them be cross-functional, I think I've forgotten about the importance of this and need to reevaluate this

> They asked each platform team to prepare a road map for making improvements that would support products while also modernizing the platform’s technology.

- [ ] We need a roadmap from each platform team, I know Chirayu has shown this, might need to revisit this as well

> This collaborative approach sometimes calls for platform experts to join product teams temporarily.

- Identify who can join us temporarily, kind of like how we had Pavan, Eric and James sit with the Mosaic team

- Are we tracking these metrics? If so, how are these being tracked?
- If not, how would we go about tracking them?

- We need to align with other Product Teams, Platform Teams and the Business priorities
  - If this has been figured out, I am not aware of it

> _Most product teams will have a leader who is more business oriented than technology oriented._

- This fits Sam really well, we need more like her

> To minimize conflicts and surprises, every dependency should be addressed on at least one team’s release plan.

- This is what Matt is talking about! We need to figure out the dependencies, not just the work but also the teams and the people
  - What is their workload like in the next X amount of months, we need to coordinate with them

> Other practices, such as feature flagging, can prevent dependencies from delaying releases.

- Do we have any sort of feature toggling? Can we enable this? Do we want to do this? Think about the problem rather than the solution, what is the problem here?

- This goes with alignment as well
