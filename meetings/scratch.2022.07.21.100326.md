Email is sent to Application Assurance

On question 3, we need to choose "Custom Intregration/App/Service"
instead of PaaS
It went to the Privacy team "Privacy@sherwin.com" 

We need to submit the form again

Brian Playteck

If we go-live and there's a security breach, who takes ownership of that, and we have to pay many millions of dollars

We are using OAuth, making sure the user is authorized to do what they're going to do 

Their automation tools will not test the authorization
UI, Service and Endpoint

We are going to update the authorization, we should be looking for patterns

- [x] Reach out to Privacy@sherwin.com
- Shannon will update the form so "PaaS" is removed as an option
- Shannon will reach out to Brian Playteck to see if we can still go-live MOnday
- [x] We need to resubmit the form

- The assessment and scan and results will take about 3 -4 days

- Should Shannon's team do a manual Pen test on this?
  - Tacks on more time

- Follow up with Raghu and the sec team
