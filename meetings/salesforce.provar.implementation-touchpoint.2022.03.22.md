### Metrics
- Let's not focus on how many tests, but how many people *are* writing tests
  - Shows that people can use the tool AND they can write a test
    - @ChrisJohnson
    > Nothing stops them from doing more  
    > The more people use the tool, the more in-PI automation can be done

### Notes
- We don't want others to be writing tests all day
- If it's a total number of tests that are being asked for, then we just show them how many tests we have
- "Information is power and with great power comes great responsibility"
- [x] ask @Sarat and @Tao what goal(s) they would like to see
