Hi Dan and Bill,

Thank you for your time this morning in interviewing me for the Sr. Scrum Master role and answering my questions!
Thank you for all your wisdom and insight and sharing your thoughts on me as a Scrum Master, as well!

Knowing what the pods are like and how people are wanting to learn agile is very exciting and I think I could really make a positive impact!

If anything was unclear or you have additional questions, please reach out.

Hope to talk with you both soon! :)

Thank you,
Taylor
