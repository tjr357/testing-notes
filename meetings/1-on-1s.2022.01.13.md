## Go over
- Provar
- Skilling Pilot
- Demoing to PO
- Job Fair

## Discussion
- Keep in mind what Bill did as a Scrum Master 
    - Servant leader, influence without direct authority
    - listen and facilitate
    - personality
    - ability to relate to just about everybody
    - get people talking and pulling information out
    - asking open-ended questions, not just a yes and no response
    - holding each other accountable
    - provide that safe space
    - Dave and him built that relationship on trust, critique each other respectfully, to help each other
    - it's not:
        - babysitting
        - not just updating the board, it's the team's job but make sure they're doing it
        - implementing agile, but rather discuss agile 
- Demo, Showcase to all the PO's, from the user focus, make it professional, prepare for it and practice, think of it like the output of the innovation day.
- It's either Kate or I
- Just a selling demo for the Order History, sell it to the PO's, highlight it's benefits, be prepared and guide them away from tech questions, keep it moving in hte direction of the user
- Get it recorded
- IP sprint demo
- Create a demo script for myself 
- Quick slide(s) to show history and inspiration, high level benefits
- PO's and audience Kyle, Terry, Shannon, Mike Loveday, Susan, Ashley, Service team Aubrey
- Demo the first week of IP Sprint 2/9, schedule on the calendar 
- Rope in Dave and or Kate for some help
