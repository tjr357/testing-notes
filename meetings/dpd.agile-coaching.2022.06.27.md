- Communication
  - Cameras
  - Lack of participation
- Jira
  - Stories, Tasks, Sub-tasks
- User Stories
  - Not sliced small enough
- Sprint Goals
- Struggling with visualizing dependencies

#### Risks/Concerns

- No dedicated PO
- No dedicated roadmap in Jira
- Hierarchy within the team
- Business still in mode of telling IT what to do
- Several sprints we have NOT met our Sprint goal
- No dedicated QA tester
- No Automation Unit testing

#### Questions

- What's one thing I should focus on?
- 
- What's your goal as an agile coach?

- Where's the frustration with the developers and POs
  - ??? Seems like we were trying to have a demo
- Keep building that network and working with mentors
- Do team builders, remote games, retros
- Let people be themselves
