- @people.BrianComiskey will touch base with @people.SureshThota on getting set up for testing

- We may not be ready until the end of the week to do the Workbench demo
- We are not most likely on target for these 

- We went through another team to get a (Workbench) DB, we had no idea that it was going to take this long
