Hello everyone,

We're excited to share with you that we will be hosting a brunch Potluck in the beginning of August! There will be two days to choose from, August 2nd (Tuesday) and August 3rd (Wednesday). Both will be hosted in the morning (8:00 AM - 10:30 AM).

**What's a Potluck?**

If you're not familiar with what a potluck is, it typically means people bring food dishes to share with one another. It's a great way to try some diverse cuisines, swap recipes and get to know each other better. Nothing brings people together like good food!

**Next Steps**

- You will be receiving a quick Microsoft Form asking which day you prefer. If you're not able to participate or choose to be excused, you don't need to fill out the form.
- After the survey, you will receive a link to PerfectPotluck.com. This website will help us coordinate the potluck, you just enter your name and the dish you will be bringing. Dishes **do not** have to be homemade and you could also sign up for drinks and utensils if you would prefer to do that.

**I need my coffee...**

Nourish Cafe will be providing their coffee.

**Food Allergies?**

We will be providing labels for people to stick next to their dish(es) to inform you of any possible food allergies. 

**What if I don't bring a dish?**

In order for there to be enough food for everyone, we do ask that you at least bring a small dish and/or sign up to bring drinks or utensils.

Please reach out to Taylor Ruiz or Yvonne Horner, if you have any questions.

Thank you,
