- Update the Sprint Metrics after Sprint Planning and right before the end of the Sprint, maybe before the Retro
- Keep focus at the User Story level, otherwise I could end up micromanaging

- Consider a longer Sprint Planning for the PO to be there, maximize their time
  - Get on a cadence
- [ ] Create a "here's what I want to discuss with PO"
