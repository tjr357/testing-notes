Test Manager

Samuel Arroyo
- 

- He mentioned publishing/exporting PMD, 
- This is being considered for the future 
- Integrating with Jira is being considered as well

- Testing lifecycle tool
- Will help QA teams throughout the lifecycle
- Need a tool that's flexible, good integrations, needs to be fast and secure

- Test Manager and Provar Automation integration 
- As long as data is there, reports can be created

- People may use Test Manager separately from Provar Automation

- Test Manager release date end of April
- Jira: Import test projects, issues, sync defects, 
    - We will benefit more when we migrate to it
- DevOp Center (Salesforce offering)
- Test Advisor - when tests break, Salesforce will be able to tell us if *they* broke it 

- Most likely part of the Provar license
- It is free for the beta program

- Where will the package be installed, it will have to be in Production

- Install app, give feedback, create some test plans, cases, etc. 
- Make some time to use it and then have a follow up session 2 or 3 weeks

- Could be installed in a Scratch org

- Samuel will give us the info

Other SF apps
- Agile accelerator, Copado
