Hi Chirayu,

Thank you for meeting with me again this week, this time for the Sr. Scrum Master role! 
It was good getting to know you a little more and thank you for answering all of my questions. I do hope that my passion and knowledge for agile shined through. With the support from the top down and my positive outlook on this journey, I know I can help the team(s) self-organize, size stories, facilitate retros, help groom the backlog and plan using select metrics. I would love the opportunity for us to work together and help drive the Digital Transformation.

If anything was unclear or you have any questions, please let me know.

Hope you have a good weekend and talk to you soon! :)

Thank you,
Taylor
