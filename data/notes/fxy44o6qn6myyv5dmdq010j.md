- Include Brian, next time

### What's going well?
- Communication is going well
  - Being able to reach out at a moment's notice to any one, informal and formal meeting
- Team foundations are getting established

### What's not going well? And Ideas
- How are Workbench and QC Product integrated and how are the 2 projects being allocated, to help us unblock cards, etc. 
- MVP change?
  - Having a doc to state what's to be done in the MVP, should be created, source of truth, signed off
  - 
- We need consistency on the project
- Working out of order? 
- It feels very Waterfall-like 
- What's the value that we are providing? 
- Workbench vs. IOM
  - Work is being duplicated across the teams/projects
  - There appears to not be any communication about the overlap on these 2 projects
- We have personas and we are not using them!!
- Does Matt need to have a discussion with Sam's manager, Tom? To help with PO availability
- Business Relationships
  - Do I need to talk with Joe?
