<p>The way we're working looks like waterfall</p>
<p>We don't have to have an ENTIRE screen completed before we deliver something</p>
<p>Don't get hung up on the terminology</p>
<p>Rethinking how we're going to deliver it </p>
<p>How long will it take to deliver an epic, discuss it, break it into stories (deliverable), not the whole functionality, pieces to the puzzle, when completed is the FULL deliverable</p>
<p>Why spend the time making the tasks, rather than just do them</p>
<p>Allentown/Macungie is our biggest facility, why did we ship to them first?!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>Dan, Marianne and Kyle need to stop being the voice of the customer</p>
<p>Working and working as well as it could are different things</p>
<p>UX and agile timelines are not in-alignment </p>
