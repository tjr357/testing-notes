## Notes

## Goals
### Scrum Master Role
- Best defined role just about anywhere, yet there's a lot of confusion around the role
- SM is NOT a Project Manager
- Project Managers will not necessarily become Scrum Masters
- Define vision
  - Embrace Scrum throughout value chain
  - Smoothly onboard new employees/team members on agile practices
  - Max business outcomes via Scrum
- Removing Roadblocks
  - Document and comm roadblocks
    - Not necessarily to create PPT's, etc.
    - Will contribute to reports
  - Look for things that cannot be removed **by the team members themselves**
  - Implement roadblock solutions
- Shielding interference
  - Maintain team's focus
  - Intercept external interference
  - Work should NOT be done if it's not coming through the SM, they must work with the SM
  - Be the servant leader
- Assisting Product Owner
  - Implement feedback 
  - Help groom product backlog
    - Understand when to pull in tech debt as needed
- Being a Servant Leader
  - Ensure the team's highest priorities are being met
  - "What can I do to help you and the team be more effective?" mindset
  - Not a traditional leader
- Process Authority
  - Ensure team adheres to Scrum values, principles and practices
  - Enact team-specific approaches
- Coaching team member(s)
  - Improve use of Scrum and tech skills at a team and individual level
  - Host stand-up meetings for the team
    - Make sure to lead the stand-ups
  - Ensure a sense of project ownership among the team

- Scrum Master's do NOT give orders
- SM to be closer to a consultant who analyzes and makes suggestions
- Team's are self-managed
- If there are things to be worked on outside of the team, make sure that's **highly agreed on** and **temporary**
- SM's make suggestions, does NOT have authority
  - Ex. Team does NOT want the PO in the retro:
    - "Hey team, figure out how to get the information to the PO."

- SM's are helpful to their team
- Encourages the team to carry out tasks that were agreed upon
  - Don't leave any tasks behind
- SM is successful if hte team learns to manage itself
- SM should teach the team about the principles & rules of scrum
- SM should help clear any roadblocks the team faces
  - Make sure situations are taken care of
