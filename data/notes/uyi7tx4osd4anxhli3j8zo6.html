<p>Matt's Comments
"Are there work orders that are on hold that the Facility would want to be aware of how long they have been on-hold? How do these Holds impact OTIF?" - Matt Walter</p>
<pre><code>- "Could we color code or prioritize and filter to bring the on-hold orders to the top?"
- These are metrics we can track and get metrics to see if we're improving OTIF or not
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Get Dan involved in the planning phases</li>
</ul>
