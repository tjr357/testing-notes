Review meeting at 2:30 to determine the Workbench launch delay
Suresh will discuss with developers 
Waiting for QA, Azure SQL DB creation, APIM waiting for this, no users in QA DB, no tables in DB
Working with Murali, need to create passwords in CyberArk
Jason to get access to CyberArk

Steps are unkown, 
!!! Jason to document the steps

Split PCGQC-131, so QA is done and Prod will be separate
