## Notes
- POW-48 set as a New Feature
- Suresh and Chirayu, mainly discussing 
- Components in Jira
  - Each story will have multiple tasks
  - Stories will be linked to components
  - Stories will be linked to epics
    - Look into this further
    - Assigning a component to an issue at creation will automatically assign it to the designated/default user
    - Can have kind of sub-projects
    > Basically what youâ€™re trying to do with Jira components is tag special circumstances for which you may want to change the process or create detailed reporting.
