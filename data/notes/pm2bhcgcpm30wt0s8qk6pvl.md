QC Testing
Frontend  is working
Backend
Suresh to get endpoints to Mel

Guna to connect with Kiran to  

Workbench

- Jason to get up and running in QA today
- User creation
- Scott and Chirayu to do testing  

### Not in attendance

- Hieu, Jason and Guna

If we could deliver something tomorrow,
 how could we slice it?  We need to think about this differently  

 PCGQC-34

- Break off into smaller pieces  
- If Matt or Rajesh were to ask me about the launch, I would say we are good, based on what people have told me, but I could NOT quanitify it, this scares me
- Stay organized
- Get the team talking, and get them engaged, they tend to be waiting for me to say something
- Showing cameras and backgrounds, people tend to want to talk about their stuff
- Ryan will look into removing this roadblock of Jira standards and seeing where we are with this
- Happy hours and games, team builders outside of team hours 4 -5,6
