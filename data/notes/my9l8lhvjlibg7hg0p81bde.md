### Product Owner Training

#### Product Owner Time Commitment

- Good product owners do whatever is necessary to build the best product possible, need to be actively engaged

  - We're a more traditional company, change is slow
  - They've been rewarded for their previous behavior

#### Working with the Stakeholders

- Gemba walks
  - Walk to the source, have others see where the action happens
- Start saying **no**
  - "Not right now"
- Don't treat all stakeholders equally
  - Some needs are more "important" than others
- Diplomacy, negotiation
- Users have the greatest stake in the product
- Don't be a proxy between stakeholders and devlopers
- Changing focus
- Involve your SM/Agile Coach in stakeholder management
- Communication **MUST** happen
- Manage the *product*, not the team
  - The team is an equal partner
  - Help the team see the bigger picture
  - Involve the team in product decisions
- Not high pressure
  - Be available, but don't neglect your other duties
